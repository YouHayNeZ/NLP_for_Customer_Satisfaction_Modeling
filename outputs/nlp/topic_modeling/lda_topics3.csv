“a decent offering from Ryanair”,"I should like to review my flight from Faro to Liverpool with Ryanair. I booked the seat with Ryanair several months before my planned travel and found the website clear and easy to use. Ryanair sent quite frequent emails relating to the flight and attempted to sell me extras. The check-in procedure was followed by a bag-drop at Faro Airport. This was not efficient and the app they recommended for speedy bag-drop did not work. Setting that aside, I was able to check-in my bag within less than 30 minutes of having arrived at the airport. Boarding was supposedly via group but this did not materialise at all. The cabin crew had a reasonable presence and delivered a serious safety procedure. During the flight the crew worked hard and had several rounds of drinks for sale. I found the seat suitable for a flight just under 3 hours. The flight departed on-time and arrived on schedule too. Disembarkation was delayed in Liverpool while this was not the fault of Ryanair, there was no communication with the passengers as to why this was the case. Disembarkation was not orderly and was poorly managed.

"""eight of the 10 flights had delays""","This is my tenth flight with Ryanair this year - and eight of the 10 flights had delays - usually between one and two hours, but we had more than three hours too! There is basically no way anymore that you can convincingly plan longer trips with them, for example a train journey after arrival, because you never know when you arrive. Today, we are loosing another train ticket that we bought ages ago in advance, when we still believed that some delays are exceptions to the rule, rather than the new rule. Even back then, we already calculated with a one and a half hour Ryanair delay, but that is just not good enough for that ""never on time airline"". To make things worse, according to EU law, they only have to pay compensation from a three hour delay, i.e. most delays go without any sanction, meaning a contribution from Ryanair for the additional expenses their customer have to pay. Long live neoliberalism? Add to that the non-existing Ryanair customer-sevice, which leaves you in the dark about new departure time, gate changes etc, and you have the worst package you can possibly buy. What can we customers do about it? At first, let us please stop buying drinks, food and other items on flights that come with more than half an hour delay.

"""Play the game and you'll be fine""","Play the game and you'll be fine. Got a return flight from Leeds Bradford to Faro for £101. I booked 3 months ahead, didn't reserve a seat, and took only a small bag. Had my boarding pass both on my app, and in paper format (just in case). Took my own food and drink on the plane, didn't buy any of theirs, and didn't buy any of their duty free etc. It really does pay to do your research. At Leeds Bradford someone had lost their boarding pass (I think that cost them £60), while at Faro someone's cabin bag was too big. That had to go in the hold, and I expect that cost him. He said it was OK at Leeds, but maybe he got away with it there. My old bag would have been too big, but I checked Ryanair's website, and bought a new and conforming bag for £9.99. I'm 6 foot tall, and the leg room is tight, but just about OK for a 3 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable though and needed more cushioning. The outward flight took off and arrived on time. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient. No hard sales pitch for food, drink, duty free. The announcements could have been clearer, but that was down to the Portuguese captain. The return flight was about an hour late taking off, due to delays experienced earlier in the day. This happens. Allow for it.

Surely it is to assure everyone is there, can board quickly and enable the closing of the doors of the plane on time, but is quite a torture (many other airlines try to avoid such thing, probably with more differentiation of boarding groups). Furthermore, on this specific flight, the crew truly was a pain trying to sell all kind of “Duty Free” (non existing, as it was a domestic flight) items. The announcements took a full 10 minutes on a 60 min flight (sum it up with the safety instructions, buy on board of catering items, pilot’s message(s) etc), reading out all kind of “special offers” for more or less low ranking articles and was loud.

"""Well done Ryanair"" ","Took four flights with Ryanair this autumn, Nuremberg to Thessaloniki return and Hahn to Vilnius return. Flawless job. All four flights were pleasantly uneventful, departure and arrival strictly on time (that was especially crucial for me because I needed to take a bus for a consequent journey and a late arrival could be an issue). Very quick check-in and boarding (almost no queues), I'm being amazed with such efficiency of processes again and again.

"""they give such cheap tickets""","I would like to point out that the airline is a 'Budget airline' and it's pretty popular in Europe and north Africa, and RYANAIR is the most well known of them all for various reasons (mostly negative). BOOKING AND CHECK-IN: To book your flight like every other airline you do it online, through their website or their own app, booking a flight is easy enough and the first thing that will surprise you is how cheap tickets can get, some goes for less than 20 Euros, and many of them don't go over 100 Euros (depending on when you're booking), although that's very good you soon realise why the airline is hated, as when you choose your ticket you're bombarded with fees left and right for everything else besides the ticket. You have a big bag you want to take with you? That would be 30€ extra. Want to bring a small cabin bag? You can only do that by buying priority Which is at least 25€...etc the only thing you can bring is one backpack for free that weighs less than 10kg. They also try to sell you on offers such as compensation etc, but for the most part it's absolutely not worth it, so don't spend your money on them. In terms of checking you can do it for free only when there's less than 24 hours left on the flight online, if you come to check in at the airport you'll be charged 30€ for them to check-in for you and give you the boarding pass, so keep that in mind! WAITING AND BOARDING: It's the day you take your flight! Remember that when you get through security, to look at the departures carefully, because 3 times out of ten they will change their gate (that's if they show you the gate early, they usually show it until there's less than an hour for the planes departure), stay alert! After that you during boarding you must wait until it's your turn (if you don't have priority) and go to your plane! In the boarding pass you printed or given they will tell you where to board, because Ryanair uses both the front and the rear for boarding people, and rarely use normal gates. After you've boarded, sit, relax if you can, because the seats aren't the best and they aren't reclinable. The food is also not free so if you want anything you have to pay (they also don't accept cash, only cards). END OF TRIP: And there you go, you've survived the trip with (hopefully) little to no extra money spent! All and all as much as this review is negative in many aspects, to be completely fair you get what you pay for, if you know what you're doing already and/or made research to be prepared you shouldn't have any problems! It's a very good airline for the fact they give such cheap tickets to people like me (a student) who can't afford ""big airlines"" and can go with only a backpack! It's also a different story if you go with your family or friends as in my situation all my flights in Ryanair were solo!

I was OK with this and was expecting this based on their reputation. On our flight from Berlin to Venice, we were re-routed and had to land in Verona about 1.5 hours from Venice (Treviso) due to a major storm. Ryanair has no ground staff to assist people which is why they can be 'budget'. We landed late at night and 3 other Ryanair flights also landed in Verona due to the storm. There was a very nice lady employed by Verona Airport who was helping all the Ryanair customers. We were told to wait for buses arranged by Ryanair to take people from Verona to Treviso airport. People were fighting to get on the buses and we didn't understand why anyone would behave that way, considering Ryanair must surely know exactly how many buses they need to send based on how many flights/passengers had landed. Well, we were wrong. We also felt we should have been the last to go on the bus since all 3 other planes had landed before us and waited much longer. There were 40 people still left and we were told that the last bus was coming but it could fit only 16 people. Ryanair informed the airport over the phone that they would reimburse taxi fares for the remaining people.

"""Nightmare Experience with Ryanair Crew""","My recent flight with Ryanair from Lisbon to Stansted turned into a nightmare due to the behavior of two specific crew members. Their actions made the journey highly inconvenient for my family and several other passengers. It seemed their main objective was to extract extra money from travelers for baggage, which created a tense and unpleasant atmosphere during boarding. The trouble began when a passenger in front of us was forced to pay for their bag, even though it appeared perfectly fine from our viewpoint. We voiced our concerns, hoping for some empathy from the crew member. Unfortunately, this only seemed to provoke them to target us next. On a hot day in Lisbon, we had placed our jackets in a foldable bag, adhering to the baggage policy. However, as we were being briefed on the rules, we put our jackets on. After a discussion with a colleague, the crew member allowed us to proceed. While in the queue, one of my daughters, who has asthma, removed her jacket and hat. Suddenly, the same crew member appeared, ordering us out of the line and threatening to deny us boarding. Despite explaining that nothing had changed since they had previously allowed us through, they remained stubborn. They called another crew member over, and both of them joined in a verbal assault. They disregarded the fact that the extra bags were gadgets belonging to my child and wife, insisting that we could only carry four bags. Their behavior was not only rude and disrespectful but also unprofessional, displaying personal animosity and complete disregard for our well-being. It was evident that this crew member was actively seeking an excuse to single us out and personally target us. Our attempts to explain were met with increasing firmness, dismissiveness, and even mockery. Their conduct left a lasting negative impression, overshadowing what should have been a smooth and stress-free journey. I am deeply disappointed that Ryanair employs individuals who lack professionalism and take their frustrations out on innocent customers. This experience was disheartening, leading me to question whether I would choose to fly with Ryanair in the future.

"""an extremely frustrating experience""","I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with Ryanair that left me disappointed and dissatisfied with their service. Despite it not being mandatory to complete web check-in for my flight, I was unjustly charged a hefty fee of 40EUR due to an error on their part. Upon arriving at the airport, I was informed that I needed to pay the additional fee because I had not completed the web check-in process. However, according to Ryanair's own policy, web check-in is not mandatory, and passengers are still able to check in at the airport without incurring any charges. I found it incredibly unfair and frustrating that I was penalized for their own mistake. The customer service representative I approached for assistance was unhelpful and unsympathetic to my situation. They showed no willingness to resolve the issue or provide any explanation for the unnecessary charge. This lack of professionalism only added to my dissatisfaction. As a frequent flyer, I have had positive experiences with several other airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and go above and beyond to rectify their mistakes. Unfortunately, Ryanair fell far short of these expectations. The incident left a sour taste in my mouth and has significantly impacted my perception of Ryanair as a reliable and customer-centric airline. The lack of transparency and the unwarranted charge have made me question their commitment to customer service and fairness. I strongly advise other travelers to be cautious when booking with Ryanair and to carefully review their policies and fees. It is disheartening to experience such disregard for customer satisfaction, and I hope that Ryanair takes this feedback constructively and works towards improving their service and rectifying their mistakes.

"""Will never fly with Ryanair again""","I had thought Ryanair would have improved over the years, but I was completely wrong. The cheap flights are completely offset by added charges. Firstly with bags, the size they provide as acceptable cabin bags are miniscule - barely enough to fit a days worth of clothes and items - so we purchased a cabin bag. The cabin bag they allow is the size of a usual carry on; the small wheeled suitcases so many people use. However when we got to check in, everyone with us (after the priority boarding) had these suitcases with no problem? We paid to have a bag checked in, when everyone else carried theirs on with no problem. That was £55 extra. We then had to pay to sit next to each other, as I was travelling with my partner. We paid for this on one flight, and for the return flight we checked in as soon as online check in was open. Even though there were only a couple of seats already booked and the entire plane was empty, it deliberately seated us far apart in order to make us pay more. When it says they cannot guarantee you will be seated next to each other, take it to mean they will deliberately seat you far apart in order to get more money from you. Finally on the flight, having a flight attendant scream right next to you, as they yell at their colleague at the other end of the plane was interesting. Even more so was the aggressive way they do anything. I walk using a walking aid, and I called up to check this was ok before I boarded. After being told it was ok and that I would be able to keep the walking aid between my legs, an attendant roughly grabbed it on the flight and shoved it into an already full overhead locker, and then slammed it shut several times until it closed. This cracked and damaged the walking aid and I've now had to purchase another. When I submitted a complaint about this, I was told I needed to have filled in a particular form at the airport. I have never had an attendant damage the items I use to walk around before, and at no point does it say that if anything is damaged you need to fill in a form at the airport. I was then stuck in a loop of calling in to discuss this issue, being told to reply to an email and then being told they would do nothing as this form was not filled in. Ryanair remains a predatory airline - you will not pay the low amount you see online. Avoid them, and give your money to any of the other budget airlines if you're looking to save money.

"""Overall a decent flight""","This review relates to my second flight with Ryanair following a trip to Fuerteventura. The check-in staff at Fuerteventura airport were very professional and friendly too. Boarding was something of a mishap as there was no reinforcement of the priority boarding. This caused an upheaval as several passengers, rightly voiced their grievances over this. This was a very full flight including several family groups. The cabin crew were far more professional than on my outbound flight and imposed a strict no nuts regime as a passenger had a nut allergy. One crew member stood out from her peers, who was not only very professional but seemed to go the extra mile to assist an elderly couple and to help a lady who was unwell. This crew member is a great credit to Ryanair and deserves recognition for her professionalism and common sense. During the flight 2 to-buys drinks and snacks rounds were performed and again the crew did very well indeed. Although there was a delay of circa 50 minutes to departure this was communicated very well to the passengers. Disembarkation was quite something as a problem passengers stood up before landing and ignored instructions to sit down. This passenger rudely pushed his away along the aisle and brushed a cabin crew member aside. Astonishingly poor behaviour. The cabin crew should not have to deal with such appalling behaviour.

Follow the rules and one should be just fine within the remit of budget travel! I checked-in online without any issues and when I arrived at the airport, the priority boarding was largely enforced. The flight had a slight delay but communication was reasonable. Another let down was the poor attitude of two staff members. One lady seemed to do all the work while her colleagues took a back-seat attitude. I had a negative experience when I needed to use the lavatory. I politely asked a male member of the cabin crew if the lavatory was free? I am visually impaired. To my shock the staff member in question sighed and mumbled something in another language without answering my question. Disembarkation was a farce as the abusive woman and her brood pushed to the exit without any of the cabin crew correcting the dangerous behaviour eg standing up and removing bags from the locker before the flight had even properly landed.

"""treatment of passengers is inhumane""","I seriously thought we would never get home safely ... but that was not the only terrible part! After a nice week of vacation we take a Ryanair flight from Porto to Milan, estimated duration: about 2 hours (?). We are almost to our destination but we are told that we cannot land because of a thunderstorm. Result: we stay for more than an hour and a half suspended in the sky amid black clouds, lightning and thunders at close range. After that we are told that it will not be possible to land in Milan, so they take us to another airport (without telling us which one, except once we land!). We finally land in Genoa, tired but glad to be on land. Another hour and a half of waiting and we are told that we will be departing again? In the meantime, no one offers us water, food, but the captain tells us that we have ""permission to contact family and relatives,"" if we desire. In the meanwhile, we contact our hotel to alert them to the uncertainty of the situation; they unfortunately warn us that it will not be possible to check in in the middle of the night (it was midnight by then). We arrive at Milan Linate and manage to catch the last shuttle to downtown Milan, where we squeeze into the first hotel next to the Central Station, in order to make as little distance as possible at midnight with baggage and personal belongings. Bewildered but exhausted and thus resigned, we pay three times the price of the hotel originally booked, which did not allow us to have a refund because of the short notice. Finally, once back home we decide to pursue a refund request (end of July 2022), promptly rejected because EU261 regulations do not provide for refunds due to ""unforeseeable"" conditions. We call support again, who suggests we ask for compensation instead of a refund (August 2022).

"""flight was delayed by over 3 hours""","It all started what now seems a lifetime ago when sitting enjoying the sites of Lisbon City centre when my partner checked the Ryanair app out of mere curiosity to find our flight was delayed by over 3 hours. Inconvenient yes, but perhaps we could enjoy a few extra hours before heading to the airport? A quick chat with customer services should easily tell us if that's OK or whether we must be there for the original departure time.  After 20 minutes of fighting the customer service chat feature we gave up. A completely automated response to all questions, none of which related to the query at hand. Fast forward to the airport - the main terminal looks nice but we get shuttled off to the budget terminal.  Past security, not fun but not the fault of Ryanair at least. The delay is over 4 hours now so a quick search online shows we are entitled to food and drink. Best find a member of their helpful crew who will be happy to help! A walk of all the gates though provides slim pickings .. perhaps they don't want to help the people from the growing list of flights being delayed? When we did track down a member of staff at a gate, we were  ushered through a gate to a Ryanair desk that could help, only to find on going through the door that it was a one way trip - back to the initial check-in slaughterhouse. I feel by this point we all know what the response was at the check-in desk - go and ask at the gate of course. We tried to argue briefly. We took the tickets, we accept our fate. At least the comforting knowledge we received from the checkin desk that someone will come out and offer help from Ryanair back at the gate will keep us warm over the upcoming hours of woe. Back at the gate now. Security was even better the second time around, apparently they don't like boarding passes being used twice. When we mentioned Ryanair though they seemed to get it.

"""let down by the cabin crew""","This review relates to a Ryanair Flight from London Stansted to Rimini in Italy on 26th July 2022. Firstly, the website is logical and well set out stating the rules and policies of the airline. Follow the rules and there are no problems. I should like to commend the Check-in staff for their help and efficiency. I took a train from London to the Stansted airport unfortunately the luggage of another passenger ripped the top of my bag. The check-in staff noticed this rip and were very helpful towards me. Boarding the flight was another matter as there was a rather large group of Italian teenagers returning home to Italy. Their chaperones were badly organised and the Ryanair ground staff did not manage this well resulting in a delay to the flight of about forty minutes. None of the ground staff showed any initiative in this situation. None of the ground staff spoke any Italian and there was no effort to translate to the teenagers.  Passengers were allowed to queue in the bridge before the flight was ready to depart. There were steep stairs to be negotiated and I assisted an elderly passenger with the stairs as no warning had been given about the stairs. The security demonstration was reasonably well conducted. Service was lacklustre with one cabin crew yawning over her passengers and rolling her eyes and looked bored. The lovely lady who sat next to me ordered a prosecco and was gruffly handed her drink and a cracked plastic glass. The drink spilled over the lady and the male cabin crew showed no interest and seemed to expect the passenger to continue drinking from the cracked plastic glass. The male staff member had to be asked to find some paper towels and to replace the glass. He sighed indignantly when asked to do so. At one stage a member of the cabin crew locked the lavatory and caused a line to form. There was no apology or explanation either. The landing was fine but disembarkation was chaotic and poorly managed. Based on this experience, I would think twice about booking with this airline again. The ground staff were superb, friendly and polite and very helpful.

"""Good luck if you book Ryanair""","Firstly, as a member of staff at the airport I must say, I hear alot of bad things about Ryanair but let me tell you as someone who meets many passengers and works close to the action, my knowledge about Ryanair at Manchester Airport is huge. There isn't much room for a person who is overweight in 1 of Ryanair seats, they'll probably be uncomfortable for the whole flight, especially next to the window. Ryanair use Terminal 3. It's a no smoking terminal. Ryanair quote, ""low fares"", but they mean the starting price is a low fare. It soon adds up to cost just as much as easyjet or jet2. When you board or come off a Ryanair flight you'll find it's always up/down the steps not through the airbridge. When you're waiting for your suitcase. Expect to be waiting for at least 1 hour and 30 mins. Otherwise you might loose your mind and take it out on the wrong member of staff....like me. On our way home from Rome we arrived at the airport, got through security. I decided to check my phone to see where the plane was using Plane Finder. The answer to my question....Manchester. It had literally just taken off. We left nearly an hour late. During the flight we were told no food or drink available. Imagine if we purchased an inflight meal. We arrived at Manchester but spent 3 hours waiting for our bags because Swissport must've only had 3 people unloading each Ryanair flight. So we were 1 of 3 flights landed. For 3 planes there is a maximum of 3 baggage handlers. I know this because the baggage handler told me. I decided to ask him what abuse he was getting from a passenger who landed with me that day.

We showed her the boarding pass and she immediately demanded that we follow her to the desk. She told my nephew that he had a non-priority ticket and said ""I need your credit card."" When he asked why, she said he had another case and needed to pay £45 now or else he could not fly. She and her colleague seemed to feel proud of the way she had put us on display embarrassing us in front of everyone else who had now lined up behind us. We were being stared at angrily as it seemed we were holding up the queue. I thought I had paid for priority tickets as I paid for fast track and selected seats. I showed them the icon on my Ryanair account after logging in and the responded saying they didn't know what that was. They had to call someone on the phone as my nephew who is American provided an Amex card. They kept us at the desk in front of everyone who thought we were holding up the queue for more than 10 minutes. I asked and they wouldn't give me any more information. Eventually, my nephew got his passport and his boarding pass back and they started embarking. They asked us to wait even though I had paid for fast track and we were already at the front of the queue. They deliberately kept us there and let us board after I became upset. When we boarded we were confronted by the flight attendant who told us that the cabin bag we had just paid for needed to be in the cargo bay even though it's smaller than normal cabin cases. I advised them we had paid and pointed at the tag which was snow taped to the bag and she insisted that we should have been told to put in cargo. I tried to explain that they didn't tell us and we wouldn't know that as we don't work for the airline.

Within 20 minutes we were upstairs again with our results, but the two employees had closed the check in counter, after they had told us to run downstairs to get a test and then come back for our boarding passes. We couldn’t get our passes online because it directed us to the ticket counter, but the ticket counter had stranded us. The rest of our party had headed through security while we got our tests and approached the Ryanair staff on that side and told them our dilemma.

They told us we had to book new flights because no one was at the check in counter. We were early enough we would have made the flight had someone been at the check in counter to simply print our passes (as we had checked in online). Our party members talking with the employees at the gate talked with them for 50 minutes trying to get them to send someone to log in but they refused.

The staff was unresponsive, with the manager also refusing to get our passes and when told about the seizure situation was told that if they seized “we would have to take them to a hospital”.

"""Beware of the 3rd party services""","Beware of the latest scam - 3rd party services booked on the Ryanair website: I was flying from London to Malaga and, when I purchased extra hold luggage the day before I flew, I decided to, at the same time, also buy a ticket for National Express from Victoria coach station to Stansted airport. I did so and paid one amount on my credit card, but I received no confirmation of the National Express booking, so I called NE and they had no record of my booking or payment. I did so again the next morning - still no record, so I had to buy the ticket again at a higher price. I tried to call Ryanair, but could not get through to them, nor had any success with their ""live"" chat. After arriving in Malaga I tried to get a refund from Ryanair, whom I had paid, but they said that I needed to get this from NE and that it had nothing to do with them as NE were a third party service provider. All my explanations that I had paid Ryanair and NOT NE were ignored. So I called NE again and they still said that they had no record of the reservation or payment, so I had to make a claim against my credit card company for a refund. All this took several hours of my time and was incredibly stressful. It was a relatively small amount, but I was incensed by Ryanair's approach and determined to get my money back. They are truly shocking in their customer service.  Only fly with them if there is NO alternative, even if other airlines are more expensive. Only buy the most basic/cheapest ticket and only upgrade or buy extras (seat choice, hold luggage, food, etc) as late as possible and just before your flight - in case there is a change of plan or cancellation, then your refund amount is much lower.

"""no patience, no kindness, no respect""","There is no word in the English language that can fully describe how bad this airline is. I’ve had my shares of bad experience with Ryanair but always thought “Well, my bad I should have been more prepared I guess” or “they are probably having a bad day, cut them some slack” etc. But if you’re going to be aggressive and verbally abusive to two senior travelers, then we’re going to have a real problem. Even more if the seniors in question are my parents who have a limited knowledge of English. My parents came to visit us this weekend. They arrived in London fully prepared, vaccinated, passports, forms, VeriFly app literally everything that was required and asked of them. They flew in with BA at Heathrow and everything went smoothly (take some notes Stansted!). Then we prepared their return journey and they made sure to book 2 handbags (that’s how it works now you have to pay for handbags too). So, prior to the trip they booked two ‘less than 10 kg handbags’ on the agency’s website which gave them also the right to priority board (something they were not aware of). They actually waited and queued until it was time to board and once in front of the person at the desk were asked to pay £90 for the two bags. My dad tried to explain he already paid for it, but she didn’t want to hear it, she laughed to their faces because they tried to explain themselves with the few English words they know, and then she realized that my dad speaks Spanish (apparently, she did too) so they managed to understand each other to some extent. She lost patience and told my parents it was either they paid for the bags, or they had to leave them behind. Scared and tired by the situation they decided to pay and after they got the confirmation and the sticky tag on their bags asked if they could get an invoice or receipt. The lady said she didn’t have it and that they will receive it by email. However never confirmed it with my dad and asked them to quickly move towards the plane and embark. Then someone - I'm guessing who's a security person - yelled at them in the corridor in English (remember a language they don't understand) and kept screaming and shouting at them for a good minute without thinking they might not be able to understand his language. Literally no patience, no kindness, no respect. My parents managed to connect the dots and gathered that he wanted them to leave the bags outside the plane (remember small handbags less than 10 kg) they pointed a corner to him, and he let out some kind of agreeing grunt. Then once on board they probably were thinking they could finally relax, but no, once again someone with a lot of empathy and sympathy decided otherwise. The hostess that day kept asking my mum to remove her jacket, and put it up in the overhead bin, then underneath the seat, then finally take it back and put it on her knees because it wasn’t right, and every 5 minutes came back to check if she was ""cooperating"" because she also asked my mum to remove her scarf and for some reason it needed to be left with the jacket. What is wrong in your head? When a lady of a certain age is cold, you pressure her into removing her clothes? First, I don’t get what the security hazard is with a scarf. Second, it’s literally freezing outside, and we know how cold it can be inside the plane before take-off, also ever heard of covid. I mean come on.

"""Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help""","Our flight from Crete to Athens started off with online check-in issues. We followed the prompts, but there was no option for check in, only to cancel or change flight. We even watched a video but never was presented with a check in option on the mobile website. When we arrived at the airport, we spoke to one of the employees at the bag check line, and explained to her our issue with online check in. She offered no help or advice, only said there is nothing for her to do and that we must pay €55 each to print our tickets or we could speak to her coworker at a Skyserv help desk. We proceeded to the alternate employee at the Skyserv booth and once again explained our troubles with online check in. We even showed her the step by step process in which we tried to check in on our mobile phone. She started to raise her voice and said “I don’t know why you’re the only people having an issue. Other customers don’t have this issue. It’s clearly something you did wrong!” Instead of providing us with actual help and presenting a fix to the issue that we physically showed her on the phone, she was dismissive, blaming us, and outright rude. When we wished to escalate the matter, she refused to tell us her name and began acting even more erratic. She stated that “Ryanair will know who I am and I don’t have to give you any information.” At this point we were forced into making one of two decisions - miss our flight or pay €55 for each boarding pass. Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help, we returned to the bag check desk, and decided to go ahead with the payment. At our second interaction with the bag check staff, we were informed that the price per boarding pass is now €62.50! We showed them the Ryanair email that said it was €55 and explained to said staff that she told us ten minutes prior that it was a €55 fee. The employee told us to look at her screen if we have an issue, because that’s what it says and she could give no explanation for the discrepancy in Ryanair email or what we were previously told. At this point we were uncomfortably coerced into choosing to either miss our flight or pay this new arbitrary price that no employee could give an explanation for. No one can explain to us why we were unable to check in online and no one can explain to us why there was an increase in price after this entire debacle. Fast forward two months after this incident and multiple complaints to Ryanair, they finally responded with again no resolution. A representative from Ryanair emailed stating, ""At first, I would like to express our sympathy regarding the circumstances resulting in you being unable to have done the check-in online. However, if a customer does not manage to check-in online then an airport check-in fee of €55/£55 per person is applied."" This acknowledges our inability to check-in, but somehow still place the blame on the customer.

"""truly horrible experience""","I had always promised myself I’d never fly Ryanair but this time they were my only option. First up, booking and checking in etc. I found it pretty simple, I heard horror stories about people being charged ridiculous sums at checkin for boarding passes etc but so long as you read the instructions on the website you can’t really go wrong. And that’s the only positive thing I’m going to say about Ryanair. The aircraft was a new looking 737-800. On my flight out to bud from stn I was lucky enough to have an entire row of seats to myself, despite the rest of the aircraft being near capacity. Any airline I’ve flown with, in hot weather, will have the cabin a/c active for boarding. Not Ryanair. We sat in 30 degree heat for about 30 minutes with not so much as a breeze.  That didn’t really matter though, because the overhead fans were just awful. On this aircraft were recessed into the facia, so the direction couldn’t be altered. Add to that the “breeze” wouldn’t have been sufficient to blow out an already fading candle on a child’s birthday cake. I had two fans pointing vaguely in my direction, both set to full, both failing to live up to their job descriptions. The seats were they bad, narrow and with about 2mm of padding.  Now for the speedy boarding scam, I was standing in the terminal in BUD with the rest of the non speedy folk while the last of the speedy boarders had cleared the gate a good ten minutes previously. I was a little miffed up until I saw the speedy boarders all standing in a “cage” section of the air bridge (pictured) completely in air conditioned and completely open to the more than 30 degree heat. Contrast that with the regular folk who were enjoying the departure gate a/c. Both my flight to BUD and return flight to STN arrived late, yet Ryanair insisted upon playing their obnoxious fanfare.

I supposed to fly to Bologna from Prague, pre condition is to have a PCR test not older than 3 days. My husband got positive and obviously we had to go to quarantine. I reached out ryanair and only option available was actually to change flights, but for every option they were charging full price extra for luggage (it's 40 euro on top of 50 I have already paid for luggage) and therefore any option I was extra I have to pay to keep tickets was way higher than to buy completely new. So I've asked if there is a way to cancel and get at least something back even through voucher to use it for other flight, but 150 euro of one ticket thrown away. But in this particular case it's cheating on clients: we are doing here tests on weekly base and you cannot predict to get Covid before flight if you were fine week before and extra nearly full charge for luggage on top is really stealing money.

I consider Ryanair's product to be well suited for my needs. Just a seat, no frills, low price, easy way to get from A to B. Nevertheless within the last weeks Ryanair has started to arbitrarily cancel flights due to a low load factor. Somehow I understand this, when there is a sudden change in government rules and people just stop buying tickets. But now Ryanair just cancels whatever flight, that was offered a few weeks ago, just because their load factor is too low for their needs. This happened about two weeks ago and I had to rearrange my travelling, throwing away a couple of tickets from the 8 flights I had already booked with Ryanair. Now they do the same thing once again and my travel plans are totally screwed. From the few flights Ryanair offers, they just cancel whatever flight they want to, obviously without compensation.

I could not manage to get 2 weeks extra holiday, so I changed my mind and I tried to explain this to 4 customer service agents (from 11 am to 4.30 pm), they showed to me their standard rule is a 7-day change rule and did not let me change my ticket date with fees free promotion. They said - I can only change my ticket before 7 days prior to the flight. They are not a legitimate company, there are so many hidden fees. I paid for my tickets (3 people) 203 GBP with parking, but to change my ticket, they asked me to pay 350 GBP (appx.) including seat booking, extra baggage, everything I have to pay again even though I haven’t used anything. Also, they got my money for parking 10 days into a long stay, but they said they are not responsible to deal with my parking at all. So, why do Ryanair people keep scamming people like this.

This year alone they have told a party of 7 that they could either change there flight date or receive a full refund due to a Covid related issue, we selected the refund but did not receive anything, when we contacted them again they said that they could not give a refund but could change the flights, which we then agreed to, again we heard nothing further and the flights did not change, once again we contacted them and they said that they could not change the flights and we would have to wait for a refund, after several more conversations we ended up changing the flights. These flights were booked to attend a family wedding and the revised flights had us returning early morning the day after the flight, we have logged onto the app tonight to check all the details to find that the return flight has been changed and they have not made any attempt to inform us. The return flight are now 30 minutes before the wedding was due to begin. When we were told for the second time that we would have to apply for a refund we were also told that no refunds would be paid out until the corona virus pandemic had ended. On a separate flight for the honeymoon of said wedding we have spent literally 3 full days waiting to talk to a member of the team on the live chat only to be left sat in the queue all day on each occasion. We regularly travel between Manchester and Naples to visit family and this is the only airline which flys regular direct routes between the 2 airports or I can assure you, we would never fly with this company again.

"""not care about its customers""","I arrived to the airport in Rome, Ciampino and stood in line for the check in 1.5 hours before the boarding time. I was supposed to check in my luggage since I had also a small backpack and Ryanair policies do not allow the carry on of two pieces of luggage on board (the check in of this second bag was included in the ticket that I bought). While I was waiting in line (there were 50 people before me) the check in for Eindhoven suddenly closed without any announcements and I was not able to check in my extra luggage. The Ryanair lady at the counter told me that there was nothing that could be done, she told me to try and go directly to the gate and ask to make an exception so that I can bring my luggage onboard since it was a hand luggage and the check in closed without any warnings or announcements. When I arrived to the gate, another Ryanair lady told me that exceptions can not be made since internal policies obligate you to check in extra pieces of hand luggage. I tried to told her what happened but I had to pay a fee of EUR 25,00 and was not able to take the baggage on board. I was forced to hand it in before entering the plane and that was the last time I saw it being placed into the airplane hold without any damage, being perfectly intact. When I arrived to Eindhoven my luggage was returned through the luggage belt, and it was completely torn apart. I went to the damaged luggage counter to ask how to proceed since Ryanair was responsible for destroying my luggage! The lady at the counter told me that I had to fill in a complaint and then go to the Ryanair website and ask for a refund. I did everything as needed, including going to the police bureau at the airport in Eindhoven. Ryanair told me that they could not do anything about what happened except refunding me with EUR 20,00. The reason why they could not do anything about it was that, since I could not hand in the receipt of my luggage - bought some years ago - they could not make sure how much the luggage was worth, why and how on earth should one keep the receipt of a luggage that was bought years before?

"""Poorest ever customer service""","Worst airline for countless reasons. 1) Flight delayed by six hours. We were scheduled to depart at 6.05pm. Everyone had boarded the aircraft by 6pm, but we were told by flight attendants to disembark due to a ""technical error on the plane"". The flight was rescheduled to 12 midnight, but it eventually only took off at around 1am the next day - a total of seven hours of delay. 2) Zero accountability. Ground staff were completely clueless as to any protocol in times of delay. Worse still, for the next ninety minutes or so there was no follow up action and all passengers were just stranded at the boarding gate. We were told to ""come check back every 30 min or so"" and there was no assurance of what would be done. 3) Shamelessly tried to shirk responsibility. We were told we could make claims via the EU261 flight regulation. However when I submitted my claim, the airline had the gall to say the flight was ""delayed due to air traffic controller restrictions, which was outside of our control"", which was totally opposite of the technical errors that the air crew had stated. 4) Poorest ever customer service. I followed up with Ryanair customer service staff who had zero professionalism. He was nonchalant throughout the correspondence. The incompetence of this staff member is highlighted in the fact he redirected me to the CAA UK site despite knowing my flight had departed from Spain, and that CAA does not serve cases where the flight departs from other EU member countries.

Ryanair customer review,"Bucharest to Berlin. I have flown plenty of times with it, and always the same story.

The flight is constantly delayed, I think only 2 or 3 times the flight left at the right time according to my experience. This has often caused me serious problems as my final destination in Ireland is not Dublin but Galway, and the last bus I can catch is at 00.30. This means that several times I had to sleep at the airport and wait for the next bus (around 5.30 am). Many times I asked the flight crew if any options were available such as hotel accommodation (at least at a special price) or alternative transportation. Last time (a month ago) they offered a 4 euros snack coupon for a 2 and half hours delay, I did not know whether to laugh at their faces or cry!

"""you get what you pay for""","London Luton to Vilnius. I rang Ryan Air a full 14 days before my outbound flight to let them know that I would not be able to travel after all due to family/personal reasons. As I had paid for their optional 'one trip travel insurance' I told them that I would be claiming my flight costs back via the insurance policy. To cut a long story short: I was told that Ryanair has no cancellation policy and that I would have to wait for at least 24 hours after my return journey and then phone Ryanair again to request a 'Did Not Show' confirmation letter. This will form step one in the insurance claim process. As my return flight was booked for 10th November I, therefore, phoned Ryanair 12th November. They told me they will email me the necessary 'Did Not Show' letter and that I can expect this in the next 8 working days. I said that this was a ridiculously long time to wait, particularly when the customer service agent said she could see that I hadn't used the ticket and would, therefore, be instructing the DNS letter to be processed immediately. When I asked what the procedure was once I had received the DNS letter she said she did not know but was sure that instructions would be included in the email. My issues are: I informed Ryanair 24th October that I would not be using my ticket but was told that I could not start to claim back my flight costs until at least 2 days after my return flight. This meant there would be an empty seat travelling to Vilnius 7th November and an empty seat travelling back to Luton on 10th November. As Ryanair confirmed there was no way of cancelling my ticket/seat then I must assume those seats were left empty! That sounds like very bad commercial practice - not something I would expect of a low cost/budget airline. Ryanair offers 'one trip travel insurance' at the time of booking and then cannot explain the procedure for making a claim against the insurance policy. They blame it on the fact that their insurers are a 'third party'! Check! The transaction was made between me and Ryanair and I expect Ryanair to be responsible. I now have to wait possibly another 10 days simply to start the claiming process - a process which I am still in the dark about. How much longer will this take?

The only strange thing about website vs application experience is that when purchasing priority boarding you can not buy 10 kg checked bag allowance on the website. On mobile you can do this. Another thing to watch is cost of this service. It changes, and the price can double, so if you need it, it is better to buy it early. At the airport check-in desk was not overcrowded. Boarding was fast and efficient, with usual nasty waiting when priority line had to be formed on the stairs and then lined up near the plane. But flying low cost you have to accept this.

"""complete lack of customer service""","I am writing my second review for Ryanair and it is only my second time flying with them on a return flight. It is my first and last time flying with them! I strongly, strongly advise you to never ever fly with them on principle alone! Their baggage rules and deadlines are ridiculous. As a whole I paid an extra $162 Euros for a flight that was only supposed to be $94 Euros. In Canadian, that is almost $300 extra dollars so naturally I'm upset. The worst thing about this company is the complete lack of customer service. The carry-on I took to Madrid is built in the dimensions to fit all cabin flights. The exact same carry-on I took from Madrid to Porto was all of a sudden too big to return to Madrid. I tried to explain this to the staff member and the first thing she says to me is, ""I'm just doing my job, it's not my fault they weren't doing their job over there."" Note that this is the exact same company and the inconsistency is frustrating. She asked me to come with her and check the size and in my opinion it fit and she disagreed. I asked to talk to the supervisor who approached me with hostility and attitude. She called me ""baby"" and when I kindly asked her not to call me that she called me it three more times before I refused to speak to her. I went to another Ryanair desk and asked another staff member who must have been instructed by her supervisor to treat me poorly because I simply asked her, ""Where is your customer service desk please?"" All of her body language including rolling her eyes was rude and I asked her why she was giving me attitude when I asked a reasonable question. All she told me was ""third floor"" and when I asked for more specific details she was reluctant and rude the whole time. I followed her instructions just to be told by security that the Ryanair customer service was outside which this staff member did not mention. Not wanting to miss my flight, I opted to pay whatever fee they needed and was met with minimum information, being rushed and two people talking to me at once. Once said I had to pay 25 Euros and the other said I had to pay 50 Euros which I ended up paying with no print out receipt which I had received on the Madrid side. This company can not assume that everyone knows exactly how everything works and they need to learn to treat people reasonably if they are incapable of kindness. On my first experience with Ryanair I interacted with a total of 8 very poor employees the worst of which was the supervisor from Porto who called me ""baby"" after kindly being asked several times not to do that.

I understand that it's your responsibility to not ""miss your flight"" but when I arrived one rep tried to respond to my distress and I believed was berated by another worker in Spanish and then worker became rude to me, one word answers, pointing to arbitrary directions. The next person I spoke to was also rude, I asked about my options and was only given 100Euro exchange of flight option. I asked to speak to a supervisor who essentially threw a pre-written customer service paper at me. I explained that I would just like help and would prefer to do it at the airport. He walked away and I had to follow him and ask again for a number. He again was short and pointed in a direction just saying ""there"". At this point I was very upset because customer service usually responds with sympathy and kindness even if nothing can be done. I waited in line and the initial female I spoke to was avoiding me. I had to insist on receiving a number from the other male rep who reluctantly gave me an incorrect number and did nothing further to help me after I showed him it didn't work. I had to search up a correct number online and at least the rep on the phone was more reasonable, but I will never ever fly Ryanair again. The cheaper fees are made up in baggage fees.

There was only one person at the counter doing the check in for the whole plane. We waited 1 hour and 20’ to be exact until we got to the counter. The person at the counter tells us we don’t have the boarding passes printed. We had our reservation print out but not our boarding passes, I had tried to do the check in the day before with no luck. Since I was traveling with scattered internet and no printer available, we assumed we would be able to check in at the airport but no. We were sent to another counter at the airport with a Ryanair supervisor who started to mistreat myself and my family. She said we had to paid €220 as a penalty for not having our boarding passes. Of course we were not happy about this but we handed out our credit card and asked her name or employee identification number so we can later make a complaint about her mistreat to the company. She did not like that. She refused to give that information as well as taking our Credit card saying ""Why should I give you my name, I don't have to"". After these unfortunate exchange with her. I grabbed my phone to see if I could find any way to get the boarding passes online. She accused me of taking a picture of her, which did not occur. I offered her to check my phone and confirm that I wasn’t filming or taking pictures (the airport police confirmed what I was saying was the truth later) and she refused to do that as well. Her assumption was wrong and decided to punish us denying to let us board on this plane or any future Ryanair flight. We asked for help, to see if we could talk to anyone else (any reasonable person), she refused to help or to refer us to any other place that we can address our concern, she wouldn’t talk to us. We asked for any airport authority or for the police to help us out to no avail or response from anyone. In our desperation for help since we were missing our flight my husband had to yell in the middle of the airport calling the police for help to be able to get some attention but no one came. Finally we went to a different company counter and asked them to please call the police for us, the finally called them. Not only we were humiliated by this person who showed abused of her authority but we had to buy new tickets for €1000 and got stuck at the airport for 9 hours for a total arbitrary decision of someone who couldn’t prove any bad behavior on our end.  The airport police finally came, we talked to them for a while, we were quite altered by the situation by then they said they could not give us any information of this person and had no authority on the flight since it was owned by a private company so they could not help us.

Well, the low price of this flight naturally attracts you when you are booking your ticket, but if you know for different unreasonable reasons that you might have never heard before in your life they will charge you over 1000 euros and does not let you get into your flight, you might change your mind.

So we paid this money, and again we were among the first people who were at the gate to go to the airplane.

"""cunning part of Ryanair""","Rome to Seville. “Beaten on the spot” I’m not a regular flyer of Ryanair and thus have never noticed their change of policy about the checking in and the hand luggage. With a mentality that it’s similar to other airlines, I thought I could do the check-in on the spot. When I arrived at the desk, the staff told me that I had to do the check-in online and cannot do it any more now. Then I was told that I have to go to the ticketing office upstairs to pay 55 euro for the check-in and come back to him. He also told me, “You can jump the queue and come to me once you have paid.” Then I showed him my 6,9 kg hand luggage suitcase, then he told me, “You cannot bring this on board and you have to do check-in luggage. For this, you need to pay 25 euro.” Hearing this, I was very shocked. I told the staff, “This is furbo (cheating), if a person travels for the first time with this airline and does not know the regulations, he/she has to pay extra or even more than the actual ticket.” Having no choice, I went to the ticketing office. While waiting for the staff to do my check-in, a gentleman arrived breathlessly as he was running to the desk to see if the staff can help him as the departure time of his plane had changed but he did not get any notification. The staff coldly said, “No, the gate has already closed.” The gentleman asked, “Could you do anything?” The staff replied, “I’m sorry, I can do nothing.” After paying my 80 euro, I went downstairs to the same desk and to the same staff who asked me to go to pay. Then he printed out my ticket. My questions are that, “Isn’t he working at the same desk, doing the same procedures of checking in? Why can’t he print the ticket before I made the payment and can print it after I paid?” A thought crossed my mind that “This airline lives on fine and on taking advantage of those who have no or less knowledge?” There’s blame on my part for not knowing that I have to do online check-in earlier but there’s also the cunning/cheating part of Ryanair.",rome seville beat spot m regular flyer ryanair notice change policy checking hand luggage mentality similar airline think checkin spot arrive desk staff tell checkin online tell ticketing office upstairs pay euro checkin come tell jump queue come pay show kg hand luggage suitcase tell bring board checkin luggage need pay euro hearing shocked tell staff furbo cheat person travel time airline know regulation heshe pay extra actual ticket have choice go ticketing office wait staff checkin gentleman arrive breathlessly run desk staff help departure time plane change notification staff coldly say gate close gentleman ask staff reply m sorry pay euro go downstairs desk staff ask pay print ticket question not work desk procedure check not print ticket payment print pay thought cross mind airline live fine take advantage knowledge s blame know online checkin early s cunningcheate ryanair,0.0019831855315715075,0.11932960897684097,0.379416286945343,0.04131793975830078,0.0420185923576355,0.3993169367313385,0.01661747880280018,Topic_6
"""Cost 5/10 Service 0/10""","Terrible experience on the flight from Rome to Lisbon (FR2692 @ 14:20 on the 16/9/2019). We went to weigh our bags before the flight just to make sure and were surprised to find all our bags registered as ‘over weight, please pay €40’ even my wife’s tiny handbag was registered as ‘over weight’. It was obviously set to charge customers regardless and shows how underneath and conniving Ryanair really is. The staff at our gate entrance was very very rude and made us pay for our cabin bags at the time we felt most vulnerable to get onto the flight. ‘You either pay now, or you miss your flight’. Apparently ‘the rules had changed’ despite flying with the same luggage with the same airline to get to Rome (also not an issue with the same cabin bags on multiple flights). She also refused to give us her name and said they would send us a receipt of the extra €50 we had to pay for our baggage. We are still yet to receive this. Not to mention they didn’t notify us of these baggage dimension changes until the day before when it was obviously too late for us to change, as this was a connecting flight, and despite the fact we had already paid for a flight with cabin bags included. On the flight, my wife and I were needlessly split up as were a lot of passengers which left us all grumpy but no where near as grumpy as the horrible staff. Where my wife was sat there was dried blood around the seat. She also needed to use the bathroom, which was filthy and covered in urine. When she enquired as to a better option, the attendant locked the door of the dirty toilet and simply opened a previously locked bathroom. What was the point of having that option locked to customers for Ryanair’s convenience rather than the customers? Delays with our bags at the other end too.

The prices seem to appear low at first sight but in the end you end up with ruffly the same amount as with other airlines. They try to sell you so much shit you don't need. Like it was worth being in boarding group 1, going through a ""fast lane Check in""... In the end you just wait as long as everyone else because it doesn't make the whole boarding faster, but Ryanair sends you Emails saying ""better buy it, don't lose time at the airport, board hands free,..."" putting you under pressure to buy all the extras. Why would you need to book extra ""sitting together""? Despite the fact that you are able to spend 2 hours in a plane without sitting together and if needed kindly ask one of the other passengers to change seats. Ryanair's seat booking system could easily make you sit next to each other but it doesn't do it on purpose so you spend again extra 7€ or more just to sit to your beloved. All buttons on Ryanair's website which say something like ""add to card"" are highlighted but the ones which say ""skip"" are not just to make you feel you need to buy stuff. 2. The actual flight: In the airplane the whole tables are screwed to the seat so customers can't eat from them and the seats got no bags for your laptop etc. so Ryanair ""saves time"" during the cleanup for the next flight. Of course they always have some ""special offers"" in the air and they disturb you several times wanting you to buy parfumé or other stuff that you ""need right now"". 3. And what's about the luggage thing?! It always was a wired thing in every airline but Ryanair took it to another level. As it would matter if 2 kg too much on the luggage are taken out and put in your hand luggage, it's still on the same airplane?! Ryanair changed the policy of luggage in November 2018. So a normal hand luggage (55x40x20) that counts for every other airline is considered to be normal luggage for Ryanair now. And of course everyone who takes his old loved hand luggage now to the boarding gate is stopped by Ryanair and charged 25€ extra. So by bearing everything written in here in mind I cannot book any flights with Ryanair anymore and I don't recommend it to everyone else who are thinking about it.

"""impossible to get hold of customer service""","Barcelona to Berlin. I recently took my first flight with Ryanair. When I purchased my flight I added the priority 10kg bag for the extra 13€ each way. When I first got to the airport they informed me that my bag was too big. They told me the fee for oversized baggage was 40€ but I mentioned that I had purchased the priority bag and asked if that fee could be deducted from the oversized bag fee. They were very rude and blunt and told me ""too bad, it is your own fault."" In total I ended up paying 106€ round trip just for my bags. My second issue was when I got an email the night before my return flight informing me that Ryanair was on strike and to show up to the airport 3 hours before my flight, so we did. However, the flight still took off 1.5 hours later than scheduled. After arriving home, we quickly grabbed our bags and went home. When unpacked my bag later that night noticed the entire bottom of my suitcase was cracked and broken. This is a brand new high-quality suitcase and it can no longer be used. I tried to email Ryanair followed by multiple phone calls and attempting to use their 'chatbot', to no avail. So I followed up every single day for the next five days, emailing, calling and trying the chatbot. They also charge for every call to their customer service center (yes, it’s true) so I racked up quite a bill just trying to get ahold of someone. The customer service phone reps all told me different things: one person said I would have to contact the airport and ask them how I would get a reference number since I didn't do it when I arrived, another told me it could only have been done at the time of arrival, and another person just told me to fill out a contact form online with pictures attached. Calling the phone numbers I was given were either disconnected numbers or just a loop of automated voice options which lead you back to the original menu options or tell you where to look online. Dealing with their customer service was a loop of confusion and mixed messages, and my time for filing claims ran out. It’s impossible for customers to get a hold of customer service or file claims just so they do not have to deal with the issues that arise.",barcelona berlin recently take flight ryanair purchase flight add priority kg bag extra way get airport inform bag big tell fee oversized baggage mention purchase priority bag ask fee deduct oversized bag fee rude blunt tell bad fault total end pay round trip bag second issue get email night return flight inform ryanair strike airport hour flight flight take hour later schedule arrive home quickly grab bag go home unpack bag later night notice entire suitcase crack break brand new highquality suitcase long try email ryanair follow multiple phone call attempt use chatbot avail follow single day day email call try chatbot charge customer service center yes true rack bill try ahold customer service phone rep tell different thing person say contact airport ask reference number not arrive tell time arrival person tell fill contact form online picture attach call phone number give disconnected number loop automate voice option lead original menu option tell look online deal customer service loop confusion mixed message time filing claim run impossible customer hold customer service file claim deal issue arise,0.0013544629327952862,0.2386036515235901,0.396539568901062,0.007926270365715027,0.03536853939294815,0.29870373010635376,0.021503783762454987,Topic_3

In the checking desk, they check your bag says only small cabin bag is allowed which is much smaller than the standard size and ask you to pay 25 Euro per bag that is Euro 100 for my family.

"""€110 for not checking in online""","Barcelona to Cardiff. I have never experienced such a terrible flying experience than I did yesterday, 27th August with Ryanair. Firstly from having to pay €110 for not checking in online. Then greeted at the departure gates at 8:45am and not being allowed to board the plane as the “gates were closed”. We were then told to go to the Ryan Air office and when we asked where it was located we were simply told “downstairs”, no directions or help offered and we were expected to carry all of our luggage back to the very entrance of Barcelona airport. When we got there, there was quite a long queue for the Ryan Air desk. We were told that they couldn’t do anything for us as there were no flights available until the 31st of August which would have meant waiting 4 days due to a strike. Therefore we had to travel to another airport an hour away from there and board another flight with a different airline. We were not offered any compensation and I am disgusted with the service we received and it is safe to say that they have lost our custom as we will never use this airline again.

"""it adds up in extras""","My husband and I attended a wedding in Tuscany and had bad experiences on both our outbound and return flights from Stansted to Pisa. Ryanair staff in both Stansted and Pisa, were extremely rude with multiple passengers complaining about a rude member of ground staff from our outbound flight from Stansted. Ryanair have a policy where you must to pay a £25 charge if you choose to bring  a small roll on luggage for which there is ample room for and can be easily stored in the overhead locker on the aircraft. The £25 is due if you do not pay for ‘Priority boarding’ that allows you to carry on a small bag and roll on luggage for £8 ; for which there are only a limited number of spaces available and is almost always sold out. My husband was required to pay this fee and was also told by a member of staff, that he has been ignorant and had obviously ‘ignored’ his emails - which was not the case. If not there is the option to check in a 10kg case for the price of £20.40 each way. Which amounts to £40.80, for only a long weekend away. Apart from the extra costs that were not clear to me on the Ryanair website or app.  As we were at Pisa airport and boarding the plane I was given a telling off from one of the Pisa Ryanair staff for trying to assist them as we were one of the last to board by attaching the luggage tag to my husbands small roll-on luggage after we had paid the £25 fee for it (that we would now have to wait for at the baggage carousel at London Stansted airport, despite finding out that there was more than enough room for it inside the overhead lockers when we boarded the plane) and repeatedly asked ‘Why, Why, Why?!’ I had possibly attached the tag to the bag, which is completely acceptable in the UK, to which I responded that ‘I was trying to help as I could see they were tight on time’ and told firmly ‘not to do it, that is not good and Why would you do that?’. We are disgusted by the way we have been treated by Ryanair staff and by all of the extra costs that were added. We were drawn to the airline due to the flights being the cheapest at the time, however would rather pay more for a professional, courteous service without the extra costs. After calculating these costs, e, this worked out as more expensive than other airlines that we did not book with due to the fact that Ryanair seemed cheaper. Please, do your research before booking with this airline and if you would like to be treated professionally and in a courteous manner and avoid paying for things that should be and are included with other airlines... then do not book with Ryanair.

"""flight back was safe, uneventful""","Strasbourg to Stansted. We were unlucky to have an aborted take off due to possible bird-strike and the plane returned to stand. The pilot kept the passengers and cabin crew well informed when on the ground, even connecting the APU to keep us comfortable. It was decided that we should disembark with all hand luggage whilst an engineer was called to inspect the engine, and for any damage to be repaired and then signed off. This did take some time, and passengers were required to wait in the gate departure area until the Police des Frontières had given permission for us (as a 'departed' international flight) to move into a larger area where there was a café. 5 € vouchers were issued and the café coped well with an additional and unexpected 189 passengers who were on the ground for over 3 hours. The only frustrating part of our time in Strasbourg was the time delay in getting the permission from the Police des Frontières and the lack of information ... not the fault of Ryanair, or the airport, which is an outstation without official Ryanair base representation only efficient and pleasant subcontractors. Ultimately engineers arrived and inspected the engine. The aircraft was signed off as safe to fly and we re-boarded with the same crew. The flight back was safe, uneventful and everyone was glad to be home. It is very easy to knock Ryanair for various aspects of their terms and conditions, but when it comes to safety they are second to none, and the responsible action by the flight deck, even though it involved a wait, shows what really matters in safe travel these days.

It didn’t bother me whether we did or not, so I didn’t bother with that, but couldn’t then check in until 48 hrs before the flight and had to print my boarding pass (eboarding pass not available). So, effectively, unless you are going somewhere with a printer, or for less than 48 hrs you had to book seats ahead, and therefore pay for them on the flight home! Then, as the tickets weren’t priority (?), we had to pay for our bags on the way back (5 x £25 = £125 + £39 for the seats added £164 onto our bill). On top of this, the staff talked to us like we were stupid. Another customer, who was having the same issue was furious, and the staff were equally rude to him. To top it all off, the flight was delayed by half an hour without a mention or apology, the air hostess told us we had to give her our rubbish half an hour before landing or take it home, as she wanted to get home too! And then the luggage handlers broke one of our cases after paying for the privilege of putting it in the hold against my will. I fly regularly (mainly around Germany) for work, and I have never had these issues. Definitely sticking to EasyJet for this route.

"""an awful experience""","My wife and I were due to fly from Porto to Stansted with Ryanair. We had already flown to Porto with them and there were no problems and we arrived in plenty of time for the Flight passing through immigration and going to the gate. When we tried to board the plane the Ryanair employee said we could not fly. We asked why and she said my wife needed her boarding pass approved as she was not an EU Citizen. I tried to point out that my wife had a UK permanent residency card, but she refused to look and told us to ""stand over there or I will call the police"". As the plane was close to leaving, I approached her again and got the same threat. Finally after the plane left she and her colleague took us down a ramp opened a door and told us to go through. She slammed the door behind us and laughed as she left with her colleague. We were back in arrivals. As a result we had to stay overnight in Porto and book flights back to London City the next day, then train and bus back to Stansted. All in all an awful experience. I have complained to Ryan Air since September. First they acknowledged the claim and gave me a pass code to monitor it on their website. The latter was not recognized so I emailed them. No response for 7 months to numerous emails. I finally wrote to the MD in Ireland and received an email asking for copies of our travel documents, which I sent the same day. 7 days later I emailed again asking them to acknowledge receipt ... no answer. After another 7 days they emailed me to say I had not replied to their email. I replied and forwarded the original emails again one again asking for a reply. To date nothing.

"""Another good experience with Ryanair""","Another good experience with Ryanair. Great price on the ticket. Flight was pretty much on time. Staff were nice. Boarding was fairly smooth but involved a bit of queuing up, this is by no means unique to Ryanair though. Plane was new, and seats were the thin type which means you have a passable amount of legroom. Had food on board - selection was actually good, price was reasonable and quality was ok. I just don't understand why so many people still criticise this airline - you're paying budget prices - what do you expect? Just don't be an idiot and turn up with excess baggage or having not checked in. Ryanair must send about 10 reminders about this, but some people seem to still miss it. Or, they figure they will just do it anyway, and then stamp their feet to get an exception - don't bother - you're just wasting your time and money, and you will stress yourself out. My two detractors are 'priority' is not really priority these days, because half the plane has it, it should really be seen as a cabin suitcase surcharge, and I think Ryanair may as well just rename it as that.

"""Overall, terrible experience""","Vienna to  Stansted. I thought that the first time I had the following experience with Ryanair it was some sort of anomaly- oh was I wrong. Ryanair would not send me electronic boarding passes for me and my family. We had to arrive at check in and get those printed. We waited in the luggage drop off/check in line and waited for 20 min. We were given a slip of paper and sent to another line. This line took an hour. Several people in line missed their flights. When we got to our turn in this line, Ryanair for the 2nd time (once previously in Barcelona) accused me of not checking in and tried to charge 50 Euro fees per person to check in. Luckily, both times I had the app downloaded with proof that everyone had been checked in. The worker at the desk in Vienna made some phone calls and they “waived the fee”. We made it through security and once to the gate things were hectic again. The Ryanair attendants were treating a couple from India quite terribly, accusing the woman of having a fake visa. This went on well into our boarding time before someone took the couple away. The young woman was visibly upset at the accusations and other passengers were upset with the way she was treated - regardless of her visa status. When the flight landed in London and people got off the plane, there wasn’t a clear direction to go. I have video of a plane full of people walking around the plane wondering where to enter the airport. Overall, terrible experience.

Some of the older customers were really struggling. We should have been kept at the gate until they were actually ready for us to board.

We booked Ryanair from Stuttgart because the offered price was attractive. I’m flying quite a lot for work and I am used to normal flight practices. However, what Ryanair is doing is just fraudulent and absolutely unacceptable. For the flight to CPH we checked in through the internet, printed our boarding passes at home and everything was ok. In Copenhagen we stayed in an apartment without access to a printer. Also, I didn’t know checkin had to be done a minimum of 2 hours in advance through the internet, as this was not mentioned at all on the Print-outs of the e-tickets. Upon arrival at the checkin area, we were informed we had to pay 60 EUR per person because our checkin was not done on time (we arrived there 1h and 50 minutes before flight time), which meant an additional Eur 240 for the 4 of us. We were not the only ones concerned and just next to me was a handicapped couple, which also needed to pay. Such kind of business practices are just unbearable and fraudulent, because this information was not mentioned anywhere. Apart from Ryanair I totally do not understand how airport staff can accept such business behaviour, because at the end it’s them who force the people to pay.

"""charged 100€ for the same bags""","Flying to Santorini using this same airline, we had no issues. Coming home was a different experience. We paid extra for priority boarding both ways that gave us the option to have a small bag and personal item. The flight from Santorini to Athens was the problem. Because I was close to the front of the line, I watched about 20 passengers go through. They said our bags were too big. They are hard bags so they cannot expand. Mine fit in the bin but “not with room” and my husband was close to fitting in the bin. Therefor we were each charged 50€ (100€ total) for the same bags we brought. They made us pay cash because our credit cards didn’t work. I gave the woman 3 different cards, all of which had worked in the country. As I stood in line because my husband was forced to go to the ATM, I watched 1 bag goes through and one bag of same or similar size does not. The credit card machine never worked once. When my husband asked for a receipt, she said she could not give him one. We made her let us take pictures of everything as a result. She complied that much.

"""Terrible experience today""","Stansted to Rome. Terrible experience today! Not very pleased to say this is not my first with Ryanair. So we book our flight in March for today, 20th April 2019. We checked in yesterday and paid for the selected seats (after already having acquired Priority and 2 Cabin Bags) for 2 travellers. We leave Wales at night and get to the Stansted airport more than 3h prior to departure. The flight was scheduled at 6:25. At 5:10 still nothing is showing on the screens, so I go to the toilet and then we head straight to security. As soon as we get through security we look at the screen again (around 5:40) and the screen says ""Final Call"". Being in a a rush we run through the queues and head to gate 59. When we get there we get told that it's actually gate 91 (other side of the airport) and the lady says ""there's only 2 minutes left, you won't make it"". We ask whether she can make a call to advise we are on our way and this obviously was declined. So we start running again, with backpacks and hold luggages, to get to the right gate. This was very difficult to find and the airport staff we asked weren't that helpful. As expected we don't make it on time. We make our way to the ""Returning Customers"" gates and the airport lady did not even give advise on where to go or what to do, but simply cancelled our boarding passes and wished us a ""lovely weekend"". Lovely Easter weekend: stuck in an airport and our families waiting for us overseas! Ok, so we lose the money paid (around £90) but we don't give up on spending our holidays with our relatives and friends! So we buy the next available flight from Stansted to Rome: 13:25 same day, with Ryanair. We pay the tickets, pay for the 10kg bags and do the check-in straight away. Having travelled with Ryanair for many years I knew that they are able to refund part of the original ticket price (€100 or £79), to use this money towards the cost of the new booking. This is apparently only applicable in certain circumstances, one of which is if you show up at the Ryanair desk not later than 1h after the original departure time. We get into the queue 15/20 min before the deadline and wait for about 30 min, to then be told by the two very unhelpful and disregarded agents (who had not a clue of what this process is), that we had to speak to the Money Exchange team. We leave the queue and wait to speak to this lady who, obviously, said ""I have nothing to do with flights"". Customer Service was terrible to say the least. What happened to the ""Gate Open"" and ""Boarding"" announcements on the screen? Is it a new trend to jump straight to the last call? To cause people stress, sickness, anxiety and everything else that comes with missing a flight, including massive extra financial expenses? Or is this just the way airlines operate today? Playing sick games to ensure people miss flights and spend extra money? Initially I mentioned that this was not my first misfortune with Ryanair: 3 years ago, summer time, my flight was delayed by 3 hours...my solicitors told me that my claim for refund/compensation has been placed on hold due to Ryanair having too many complaints and not dealing with them. We are currently about £300 short due to failure to follow the process on the screen, failing to call our names for the last call (we had priority, there was plenty of time!), plus the hours lost hanging around waiting for another flight.",stanste rome terrible experience today pleased ryanair book flight march today th april check yesterday pay select seat have acquire priority cabin bag traveller leave wale night stansted airport h prior departure flight schedule show screen toilet head straight security soon security look screen screen say final rush run queue head gate tell actually gate airport lady say s minute leave will not ask advise way obviously decline start run backpack hold luggage right gate difficult find airport staff ask not helpful expect not time way return customer gate airport lady advise simply cancel boarding pass wish lovely weekend lovely easter weekend stick airport family wait overseas ok lose money pay not spend holiday relative friend buy available flight stanste rome day ryanair pay ticket pay kg bag checkin straight away have travel ryanair year know able refund original ticket price use money cost new booking apparently applicable certain circumstance ryanair desk later h original departure time queue min deadline wait min tell unhelpful disregarded agent clue process speak money exchange team leave queue wait speak lady obviously say flight customer service terrible happen gate open boarding announcement screen new trend jump straight cause people stress sickness anxiety come miss flight include massive extra financial expense way airline operate today play sick game ensure people miss flight spend extra money initially mention misfortune ryanair year ago summer time flight delay hoursmy solicitor tell claim refundcompensation place hold ryanair have complaint deal currently short failure follow process screen fail name priority plenty time plus hour lose hang wait flight,0.011946257203817368,0.08109118044376373,0.2418733835220337,0.07670741528272629,0.0009657072369009256,0.5194857120513916,0.06793034076690674,Topic_6

"""Read the fine print""","Manchester to Barcelona. Read the fine print very carefully. I did not, and I paid dearly.  Luggage: included in the cost is what you can fit under the seat in front of you. It appears they purposefully spread your group out in the cabin. For example, I had an empty seat next to me on one of our flights, yet they didn't seat my young daughter and I together. She was in the rear of the plane and I was up front. Seating together costs extra. Technically they charge for choosing your seat, but again, my opinion is that it seems they make an effort to spread families around the plane unless you pay for the seating option. Their check-in process is a scam. You will receive an email 3 days before travel telling you to check in online or you will be charged 55 pounds. Okay, fair enough because they have warned you with a personal email, until you try to check in. After you enter all your passport and personal information for you and your party and go through all that hassle and get to the end of the check-in process, they'll tell you that you have to pay a fee to check in prior to 48 hours before departure. If you forget (like I did) and remember to do so once you arrive at the airport 1 hour and 59 minutes before your flight (like I did) and try to check in online, it will cost you 55 pounds per ticket.  Here's the process: a) Wait in the queue at check in. The check in person informs you that you owe a fee. She fills out the a form (by hand) that you have to take to customer service. Wait in the queue at customer service. Pay your fee (which for us doubled the cost of our tickets). They fill out another form by hand (including credit card information by hand) and stamp it. You have to take this new form back to check in. Wait for a second time in the check in queue. You hand her this second form and she finally issues the boarding passes. Run to security because although you arrived 1 hour and 59 minutes early, most of that time has now been spent in 3 queues just to get a boarding pass.

"""I was very disappointed""","Prague to Edinburgh. This was my 5th flight with Ryanair in 7 days, and following the previous experiences with Ryanair this flight had high standards to meet. Immediately after getting off the bus from the terminal I noticed this aircraft was fitted with the old style of Ryanair cabin, this was to be expected but not to be looked forward too.  When the safety demonstration was being performed it came across that the crew simply could not be bothered with their jobs and just wanted to be at home. After takeoff the crew continued to look fed up and put no effort into providing a decent onboard service for customers. When pushing the trolley through the aircraft they seemed to show the most attention to those customers who were sat on the left hand side of the plane. The announcements made by the crew were inaudible, partly due to an accent issue and partly due to the poor PA system fitted to this aircraft. The only time I saw the crew look happy was upon landing in Edinburgh when they were seeing us off the flight. Overall, I was very disappointed by this service, especially compared to my previous experiences with the company over the last week and hope that it was simply a one time scenario and not something more common place across the company.",prague edinburgh th flight ryanair day follow previous experience ryanair flight high standard meet immediately get bus terminal notice aircraft fit old style ryanair cabin expect look forward safety demonstration perform come crew simply bother job want home takeoff crew continue look feed effort provide decent onboard service customer push trolley aircraft attention customer sit left hand plane announcement crew inaudible partly accent issue partly poor pa system fit aircraft time see crew look happy land edinburgh see flight overall disappointed service especially compare previous experience company week hope simply time scenario common place company,0.0022801696322858334,0.07601243257522583,0.06383723020553589,0.02400808222591877,0.001942640752531588,0.532799243927002,0.2991202175617218,Topic_6
"""pay again for the bags""","From start to finish everything with the process has been shocking. ‘Low fares made simple’ understatement of the century.

In the circumstances people have purchased a check in bag and gotten through to security with these bags still in tow actually have staff at the airport to help. I paid for bags to be on hold and had to pay again for the bags to be taken from us upon boarding and to go on hold. This second charge should have never happened somebody should have taken these cases and put them in hold like I had paid for. The flight going and coming back we’re both delayed, pure lack of organisation is the only explanation. Upon landing back in the UK being stuck on the plane as there’s no buses to take passengers to the airport. Surely this is something that should be pre organised? Crew members were rude both going and coming, rude to each other, rude to passengers, sat in the back of the plane on their phones. Hardly professional is it?

They explained that we had to go to customer service first. Arriving at customer service they told us that we had to pay €55 per person for them to check us in. I told them that's ridiculous since I tried several times at home and when that didn't work we tried to do it at the airport. Now she is telling us we have to pay an additional €165! So I said never mind I'll try to check in by ourselves again whereas she responds that it isn't possible anymore because it had to be 2 hours before and we already passed that so we had to pay. That really started our vacation on a bad note. On the return it was just as bad. Thankfully I did manage to check-in this time but we had priority check-in yet they just let everybody through the gate already.

"""Totally disappointing experience""","Alicante to Brussels. Totally disappointing experience, Ryanair has a questionable policy regarding the suitcases, I had to make a first payment for shipping a small suitcase weighing less than 10 kilos, when embarking I had to pay €20 extra for not having checked the suitcase, finally the cost of the flight is more expensive for this reason, there was another extra cost to be able to choose a seat as the seat allocation system assigns you separate seats from your family members so that you have to pay an extra to travel together.

It is obvious that with all extra charges even for a 10kg luggage (25€ - what passanger flies with a lap top bag only) the true ticket price is hidden and this is a price cheating. On the top many of their flights due to charging for a luggage at the gate, are late.

As soon as we got to the check in counter we were scolded by the Ryanair employee for not printing out our boarding pass (something we didn’t know as this was our first time flying Ryanair). We were instantly met with a disrespectful attitude that was unprompted. We were sent to a different counter to print the boarding passes for 44 euro. Coming back to the check in counter we were met with more scolding for having bags that exceeded the weight limit. The employee was basically appalled that we had extra weight and again sent us to the other counter to pay for being overweight (205 extra euros!). We already knew before coming to the airport that we were going to have to pay a fee for the extra weight so again we were met with unprompted disrespect; we even told this employee that we understood we had to pay more and we’re okay with that but again his reaction was demeaning and unwarranted. We did not talk back nor initiate any disrespectful dialogue and hence why I am prompted to write this review.

"""totally disorganised""","I was flying from Thessaloniki to Bologna. The weather was terrible (heavy snowstorm) and a lot of flights were either cancelled or rerouted. However what happened with Ryanair was unprecedented. Although all passengers from other airline companies were brought to their hotels by around 2.30 in the morning, passengers from 3 Ryanair flights were moved out of the airport at around 7.00 in the morning. In the beginning, the company did not officially cancel the flights so we were not allowed to take our luggage. Afterwards, we were not properly informed whether we should change our tickets (Ryanair was not going to send an aircraft the next day, so passengers would have to wait 2 or 3 days at least to fly to their destinations). ask for a refund or wait to catch a flight the next day. In addition, the online application did not work, so we had to form endless queues for any option we wanted to follow. In general, the situation was chaotic. The company is totally disorganised and left 3 or 4 employees (for whom there is absolutely no complaint, they were trying to do their best) to deal with more than 400-500 passengers (from 3 flights) without having the proper instructions from their headquarters. During the whole night that we stayed in the airport, I was under the impression that the company policy was to make us book our own hotels and therefore save the company some cash. In that respect, Ryanair vouchers are half the price compared to the other companies and they are being announced in a -kind of- secret way!!! The next day the weather was sunny so Ryanair started accommodating the flights of that day, so that the company would not have to deal with more delays, refunds etc. This resulted in the passengers of the already delayed flights being stranded at the airport for 2-3 days without any information (their flights were not even shown in the ""departures"" table). The situation was ""resolved"" when incredibly angry customers demanded to catch the next Ryanair aircraft available. After a lot of fights with the personnel and the person in charge of the airline (police presence was deemed necessary) I believe we finally boarded a plane with a different original destination. Flight was acceptable, although Ryanair did not even consider offering a bottle of water to the passengers. Do yourselves a favour, give some extra money and travel with a different company.

They wanted to charge us twice for the exact same piece of luggage (regular carry-on luggage), just ridiculous. We bought two regular Ryanair tickets approx. 3 weeks prior departure for 225€ (round-trip) per ticket on the Ryanair website. When I tried to check-in online, I realized you have to pay for luggage larger than a laptop case. We decided to check-in at the airport in FRA and asked at the counter whether our Ryanair ticket for 225€ really does not include a regular carry-on sized piece of luggage? They told us no and we had to pay 10€ per carry-on luggage/way extra, which means that we paid 40€ for our small, only luggage for the out- & inbound flight additionally. Consequently, our ticket FRA-KRK-FRA added up to a total of 245€ pp. Definitely not a low cost price, but unfortunately, we had no other option. We paid the additional costs without big discussions and received an invoice, clearly stating our names and the amount of 40€ in total for the in- and outbound flight for two.

"""priority boarding was 100 people""","Stansted to Shannon. So you pay for priority boarding? You're wasting your money. The queue for priority boarding was 100 people long when I joined the queue and even longer behind me after 30 minutes. The non - priority queue? 4 people when I joined the queue and about 20 or so when boarding started. So you pay for priority to carry your case on board? Don't bother - the non priority queue had cases just like mine. But the non priority queue on the other side of the barrier will board after the priority queue? Are you kidding? the non priority queue got on the same bus at the same time as the priority queue and a lot quicker as well as there were so few of them. Nobody supervised the gate - the automatic door opened and we all got onto the bus together. The gate number was 90. On board, it was fine - I had a window seat on both journeys (despite not paying for a seat reservation) and was happy counting the revenue stream as the bags were loaded into the aircraft hold. I counted several thousand pounds worth of revenue for Ryanair on the assumption that the bags were priced at £25 each. Ryanair are very clever in convincing the flying public to pay for priority when there is no priority - and even more clever in marketing the product so that the majority of your passengers actually take the option. I suggest that as the public catch on to this cunning revenue maximising plan you will have to change the rules again as ""priority"" boarding is probably breaking some trade description act and the public aren't stupid. However, despite this little rant, don't forget that Ryanair does offer exceptionally low prices and if it wasn't for them and other similar low cost carriers we'd still be paying extortionate prices to the likes of BA and Aer Lingus and moaning about their high fares and poor service levels.

I arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance of my domestic flight from Edinburgh to London. I proceeded through the queue to check my baggage at the automated kiosk. I weighed my bag and received an error message. The attendant told me that I needed to go to the Ryanair check-in desk to check my bag.

So I crossed the terminal and waited in queue at the Swissport Desk for 40 minutes with several other people who were in the same situation. Everybody looked angry and worried because there was only one agent handling customers, and she was moving very slowly. When I finally got my turn, it was too late. The gate had closed. When I told this to the slow attendant, she was exceedingly rude, remarking that I should have ""spoken up"" from the queue if I had an imminent flight. The problem was, every single person in the queue was in the same position that I was. Ryanair wasn’t letting anybody pay for their baggage at the baggage desk! Was I supposed to cut in line?

My flight from Bergamo to London would be departed in 1 hour They have organized the transfer to Bergamo by buses (almost 2 hours) and when we arrived finally to Bergamo, my flight had already left. I went to the Ryanair's ticket office to ask to get the first flight to London Stansted. There I found the worst service ever seen: no customer service, no support, no understanding, crazy queue, only 2 desks and they called you by numbers. It Was a nightmare after a long day. When finally was my turn and together with passengers with my same issue, we have asked to get the first flight to London because was not our fault to have missed the flight. They replied to us that they would have inserted us in a waiting list and they have asked to charge 100 euros each passenger to get the first flight available that maybe would be departed even the day after. All of that without hotel, even a bottle of water. This is absolutely shameful! I really needed to be in London asap and I have decided to pay the fee and fortunately I got the next flight to London.

"""Ryanair has lost it's appeal""","Corfu to Stansted. I feel Ryanair has lost it's appeal over the past year or so. On this recent return trip to Corfu, flights are generally delayed to some extent. Previously we always found Ryanair to be very efficient in terms of keeping to departure times. However, boarding process and splitting people up has caused chaos on board. I can understand the theory behind thir policy, and personally, for an extra couple of € I would reserve seat together. But a lot of people still take pot luck, get seats allocated apart and then try throughout the boarding process, taxi, after take off to persuade others to change seats in order that they can sit together. Middle seats being allocated in premium seating (extra leg room, front seats that others pay €15 for).

We were boarded for our flight and then left standing on a ramp in Malaga airport for 30 minutes while they cleaned the aircraft. The seats are uncomfortable and the service is lacking.

"""fast, cheap and great""","Dortmund to Stansted. What most people also dont seem to get: with Ryanair you get what you pay for. With other more expensive airlines you pay for the flight and baggage and comfort and food etc all at once. With Ryanair you first of all pay for the flight, nothing more.

People have to start using their brains instead of just expecting everything they get in Emirates First class on a 15€ flight. My two flights (Dortmund-Stansted/Stansted-Dortmund) were fast, cheap and great. I paid for a flight, I got a flight, nothing more, nothing less. Seats were fairly comfortable, Legroom was okay.

"""quick and comfortable flight""","Berlin to Glasgow. New Boeing 737-800 with the updated ""Sky"" interior, larger overhead bins and thinner seats, which I find more comfortable than the older ones, with a little bit more legroom. Schoenefeld Airport was quieter than I had seen it, but the usual crush at the inadequately-designed followed, although boarding staff kept good control of the boarding process. Aircraft arrived early, but I could see through the window that offloading from the previous flight was taking a long time, with only one person wearing a ""Swissport Duty Station Manager"" hi viz vest directing the passengers on his own until more staff turned up and put in rear stairs and started offloading luggage. This caused a delay on departure, and the Captain apologised for the heat in the cabin, which was caused by a ""lack of air conditioning power units"" at the airport, but I could see when we were departing the aircraft needed an air start unit, so obviously there was an issue with the aircraft's ground power. This resulted in a total delay of around 30 minutes, but at least the cabin cooled down during taxi to the runway. The crew were friendly, they did their jobs efficiently and although they were a mix of nationalities, the tannoy announcements in English were very clear by the 3 different crew members who made them (something that admittedly is not always the case on Ryanair flights). Two rounds of drinks and refreshments were served and one duty free trolley run performed with an announcement about special offers etc. No inflight magazines were given out on this flight, which I don't mind as I was not planning to buy anything, but may have stopped other people from purchasing items. We landed 15 minutes late in Glasgow and rear stairs were positioned quickly on the aircraft for quick disembarking.

"""an absolute nightmare""","Traveling with Ryanair has been an absolute nightmare. In a nutshell: I was travelling from Budapest to London Stansted. The flight had more than 2 hours delay when leaving Budapest. When we arrived in London at late night we had to wait almost 30 minutes to get out of the plane, since no bus was available to pick us up. After other 30 minutes queuing at passport control, we had to wait almost one hour for the luggage before we were informed that it could take few hours to be delivered, since there were no worker available (apparently they were on holidays or on strike). There were many passengers from other flights in the same condition. There was only a Ryanair representative, clearly overwhelmed and unable to deal with the situation. He finally provided us with a number to call the day after to have more information about our luggage. He did not tell us to file any report nor he provided us with any written information. When I left the airport it was 3am and no trace of my bag. The day after I tried to call that number maybe 20-30 times and none never picked up the phone. I had several chats with Ryanair representatives on the Ryanair website and I was just told to call the same number which doesn’t work or where nobody picks up the calls. I was told further by Ryanair representatives on the chat that when I call that number they will be able to fill with me a missing luggage report, because without it nobody can do anything. As I said before, the Ryanair representative at the airport did not mention that we had to file such a report, but he just provided us with the mentioned number to call. I have also filed several reports and complaints via Ryanair website by using different forms, nobody came back to me with any response. If I wanted to file a query with Ryanair Baggage Claim Form, I could not do it, without the missing luggage report number. Ryanair didn’t provide any different number where I could speak to someone who could effectively provide for help. I was finally advised to go to the airport to look for my luggage personally, since they could not do anything to help me. When I asked if I was going to be reimbursed for the travel expenses and for the time spent to go the airport, Ryanair representatives said that it was unlikely. Today still no trace of my luggage, I have received no answer to my emails and complaints, and the famous number is still not working.

On my way back I would have things to complain about, but I'm not sure how much of it is Ryanair's fault.

"""cabin crew were lovely""","Stansted to Budapest with Ryanair proved to be something of a mixed bag shall we say. I booked online and at the time thought the fare to be reasonable. The website was rather clear as to the charging policy and so I bought priority boarding and paid for a bag too. The priority boarding proved to be a false economy. Reaching Stansted was very expensive by train and entirely negated the few pounds saved against flights from my more local Heathrow. While the shambles of security at Stansted is beyond Ryanair I was concerned to see that my flight had not been on time once in 3 weeks. The bag drop was not well organised at all and the uniformed Ryanair staff member had a poor grasp of English. She actually walked away from an elderly German lady who asked for help with the bag tagging machine. The queue for the flight was poorly managed and regardless of my “priority” boarding I was one of the last to board due to the poor queue management. Sure enough, the flight was just over 1 hour late in departing for Budapest. The cabin crew were lovely people and very friendly and professional. The seat was fine for a short flight and the safety demonstration was conducted in a professional manner. If Ryanair could do something about the expensive train from Liverpool Street I would use their services again. However, due to the cost of reaching Stansted I shall look elsewhere for my next trip to Budapest.

We were among at least 12 people denied access to the flight as they didn’t have a shuttle to the airplane once to the gate. Everyone was extremely frustrated and left without an alternative and no one can provide help particularly if the booking was made online. Even the staff in Hamburg airport were unimpressed with Ryanair and noted this is simply the way they operate. The inexpensive fare was completely wasted and one loses the return flight if you don’t make the first flight. This is a “fine print airline” that may work for the experienced traveler with the patience to lose their money a few times in order to get the hang of their “method” but do not make the mistake of thinking that this is actually an air service.

"""worth avoiding this company""","Barcelona to Dublin. Horrendous experience. I flew with this airline on a return flight to Barcelona. Both flights were delayed by 1hr 30mins to 2hrs. However, it was the manner that they were delayed that was most frustrating. For both delays there was no communication from the airline. When we arrived there was no mention of delay until it became apparent that there was still no plane at the gate at the listed time of departure. After 45mins waiting at the gate we were finally allowed on the aircraft. However, the delay continued for another hour on the plane where it was incredibly uncomfortable, stuffy and hot.

This may be so but, at the end of the day, Ryanair is responsible for the agencies with which it has contracts and for the operation of its flights. When a ground agent is not available to staff a gate, that is, and should be, a reflection of Ryanair. in the case of my flight to Nuremberg, I was told that the plane was flying with delays because of a concatenation of events: a technical problem leading to a plane change earlier in the day; ongoing problems with Swissport; a loss of slot because of late servicing of aircraft by Swissport; ATC restrictions. The short flight passed without incident and the crew were competent and efficient. As usual, there was no-one available at Nuremberg to offer advice and assistance to passengers arriving almost 3-hours late.",flight time london stanste nuremberg generally take minute flight delay hour result arrival germany ryanair basic good airline want destination safely ontime ryanair year compromise safety excellent ontime record go wrong flight london stansted believe ryanair large base measure aircraft passenger number travel nuremberg notice large number flight leave delay flight delay long delay minute routine people tell ongoing problem swissport ground agent stanste airport end day ryanair responsible agency contract operation flight ground agent available staff gate reflection ryanair case flight nuremberg tell plane fly delay concatenation event technical problem lead plane change early day ongoing problem swissport loss slot late servicing aircraft swissport atc restriction short flight pass incident crew competent efficient usual available nuremberg offer advice assistance passenger arrive hour late,0.03901532292366028,0.16392236948013306,0.08429837971925735,0.0030093758832663298,0.0018829288892447948,0.5455437898635864,0.1623278260231018,Topic_6

"""miserable experience all around""","Munich to Dublin. Had 2 flights with Ryanair, and each flight was the absolute worst. My girlfriend and I checked in 3 days in advance and we were not given seats next to each other, even though the tickets were ordered at the same time and we could *see* that the seats next to each of us were available. Ryanair then prompted us ""Want to sit together?"" We could upgrade. Basically they tried to charge us extra money to get the service that you get included in every other flight. Obviously we didn't do that, and when we got on the flight it was mostly empty and everyone could sit wherever they wanted. Ryanair wasn't doing this splitting the seating to 'improve seating algorithm' or 'allow larger groups'- they were doing it solely to milk another couple bucks out of us from our ticket. Same thing in a different vein for every other aspect of the trip from boarding to arriving - boarding groups, luggage, etc. There must have been a dozen different upgrades you could purchase to bring the quality of their ticket up to the standard quality of every other existing airline. Obviously every airline does this to some extent, but the breaking up seating was the one that really got to me. Their carry-on luggage options were just as bad on paper, though the actual flight attendants were very relaxed about what could and couldn't be brought on a flight. That might depend on the people though- on paper, you would struggle to bring anything onto this flight for free as a carry-on. Caused a lot of needless anxiety as we were preparing to leave our backpacks worked for 99% of other airlines, but would they cost us $80 to bring through Ryanair? If they aren't going to enforce the luggage stuff they should relax it on paper so it doesn't cause travelers so much stress. On top of that, every other part of the trip was irritating in every way. Boarding process started ~30 minutes late for both of our flights. They accidentally left us stuck in a hot and crowded staircase for half an hour waiting for a bus. At some point during the flight they tried to sell us scratch-off lottery tickets for additional flights, which was annoying and loud and also just plain *weird*. Despite how late we always boarded, the flight was never late. The pilots cut down the flight by a lot of time. Very noticeable in landing, I've dropped my phone with more grace than some of these landings. I guess this is technically a plus but feeling like your pilot is rushing is never a good feeling on a flight for me. In summary, it was a miserable experience all around.

Boarding the plane was also fast, the plane was very clean and the crew were friendly and helpful as ever, I don't particularly like the Boeing 737, seats are narrower than in similar airbus (not Ryanair's fault, it is due to the plane) and I don't particularly like the orange on blue Ryanair scheme.

It is also not possible to change your Priority boarding to reserving a seat! The other point worth mentioning is that when you do book in the 4 day period before you fly, the Ryanair system seems to be designed to ensure that you are as far apart from your family as possible, which causes chaos at boarding as everyone then boards the flight and tries to sit with their family.

"""they would not let us through""","I thought I would flag what appears to be a persistent problem for Ryanair passengers flying from Frankfurt and the lamentable response from ground crew and Frankfurt staff. Bag security takes place at the gate at Frankfurt T2, not on entering the departure lounge (only passport needed). I arrived at the gate ~50 mins before the flight departed (let's face it - at STN with Ryanair you only generally start to board ~5 mins before the departure time) to be confronted with a large queue, all for the same flight. Security did not seem unduly concerned. Far from being last in the queue unfortunately I was directed to a very slow moving parallel screening queue for Xrays etc - which did indeed leave me one of the last downstairs to the gate, where I was witness to a queue of some 20 people already arguing with the gate staff who told them they were ""late"" and could not board. The situation was made more ridiculous as there was a half-empty bus waiting outside, for at least 10 minutes while the team of 2 on the desk refused to let more people past. Eventually this bus departed, only for another one to turn up - again we were not allowed to board this by the gate staff. Someone else turned up and we were effectively told tough, go and re-book as they would not let us through. As a result families were split as the block was seemingly arbitrarily applied from one passenger to the next - which was appalling, moreover he had medication for his wife and they still would not let the guy through nor make any attempt to get these to him. Clearly there was no communication between security and the gate which was hugely frustrating, security was understaffed as they could not physically process the volume of passengers in the timeframe (if I were more suspicious I would think there may be some 'special arrangement' to engineer this). Moreover this happens regularly - one of the gate staff told us *45* people were denied boarding under similar circumstances the day before and a quick twitter search showed this happened at least once more this same week. Overall it was a lousy experience but it seems to be a common problem - be warned if flying Ryanair out of FRA, get to the get super early.",think flag appear persistent problem ryanair passenger fly frankfurt lamentable response ground crew frankfurt staff bag security take place gate frankfurt t enter departure lounge passport need arrive gate min flight depart let face stn ryanair generally start board min departure time confront large queue flight security unduly concerned far queue unfortunately direct slow move parallel screening queue xray etc leave downstairs gate witness queue people argue gate staff tell late board situation ridiculous halfempty bus wait outside minute team desk refuse let people past eventually bus depart turn allow board gate staff turn effectively tell tough rebook let result family split block seemingly arbitrarily apply passenger appal medication wife let guy attempt clearly communication security gate hugely frustrating security understaffe physically process volume passenger timeframe suspicious think special arrangement engineer happen regularly gate staff tell people deny boarding similar circumstance day quick twitter search show happen week overall lousy experience common problem warn fly ryanair fra super early,0.028880542144179344,0.06777480989694595,0.08143685758113861,0.027556028217077255,0.00938570685684681,0.699241042137146,0.08572496473789215,Topic_6

Inside the cabin, you'll find the worst flight attendants the aeronautic industry has to offer. Those who often bump into everyone and will actually hurt you when you have an aisle seat, obviously without any apologies, that keep selling lottery tickets enhancing the flea market spirit even when turbulence requires all passengers to be seated. They sometimes forget to perform the safety procedures demonstration from start because they're on the phone. I once even heard one of them screaming when we ""bumped"" into some turbulence! Good luck trying to sleep if there are constant announcements over food, perfumes, tickets and other diversified sales. Also, Ryanair seems to think they're above EU regulations, no beverages are offered in case of a significant delay. Now the plus: It's simple and sometimes very cheap (although it often requires you to waste tons of money and pay exorbitant train tickets to reach its remote airports) Ryanair keeps growing without proper scaling and training, disregarding its customers and aiming towards maximum profit only.

"""Never trust Ryanair for anything""","Some days ago I made 2 bookings for a trip from Athens to Dublin and later on (the same day) I realised I needed to change the flight dates (and so I did) and proceeded to do it in the 24 hour grace period that Ryanair proclaims that it provides for this kind of changes. However, I was charged an extra total of 80 euros for both bookings (40 euros for each booking - 20 euros for each flight), although the old and new flight prices were exactly the same at the time of the change to the booking! Moreover, the aforementioned change happened in the 24 hours grace period (actually it was done less than 2-3 hours after the original booking). According to Ryanair's website and the 24 hour grace period (for this kind of changes) the dates change should have been at no cost (as the price of the flights at that time was exactly the same). I initially tried to address the situation with Ryanair's Live Chat customer assistance. But not only were they not helpful at all or even willing to try and check the reason for what happened, but they were also abrupt and rude. And of course no attempt at all at even pretending in trying to resolve my issue. Unfortunately, I have been a regular customer of the airline the last couple of years and I thought that if I address this matter through their website and the complaint forms (which by the way, good luck finding the proper link and form to submit one), that maybe they will be honest and upfront about the unfair charge and sort it out as soon as possible. I even sent them printscreens from the original flight prices (taken at the time of the booking and of course the new booking charges). However, the only reply I got back from Ryanair's customer service was a repeated standard reply prewritten form saying that the prices on the website are live and they may change at anytime (no one argued against that - however they don't even mention the fact that the prices were exactly the same) and that there can be a fee for changing the dates (no mention of the 24hour grace period). I confronted them replying to all these nonsense and they sent me the same reply, only to finally add the fact that once they receive a payment they cannot provide any refunds for any mistakes concerning the payment received (Great business policy, right?).

"""experience has been frustrating""","Madrid to Marrakesh. Ryanair, while servicing its customers with prices that are reasonable for flights in nearby countries (such as in my case, when visiting Spain, and flying to Morocco), knows nothing about customer satisfaction or conflict resolution. Aside from experiencing technical difficulties upon departing to Morocco when trying to check-in, my flight prior to and when boarding was equal, and my experience incredibly poor. The flight was announced to be delayed only 30 minutes, when the plane really landed over 2 hours later than scheduled. This caused for me to be stranded at the airport late in the night, as I arranged with my hotel to be picked up from the Marrakesh (RAK) airport, making me feel very unsafe. During the flight, one of the male flight attendants was being very flirtatiously aggressive with two women traveling together that I was sitting next to on the plane. Every time, in passing, the male flight attendant would take the opportunity to engage in unprofessional behavior with one girl in particular. At one point, the two exchanged phone numbers and planned to meet after the flight landed in Marrakesh (RAK), and this event caught the attention of other passengers on the flight. Also, en route, many of the passengers that were traveling in groups were kneeling in the seats, and talking to friends that were sitting behind them. This happened in multiple groups and was never addressed by airline staff. My experience with Ryanair has been frustrating and communicated very clearly to those working with Ryanair, three times. Unfortunately, it seems that Ryanair is a company that knows its own rules and regulations very well, and if you do not (as a passenger), you are considered unfortunate and will only receive a mere apology for any uneventful experience had with the airline.

In Stansted, I was told that I have to wait 26 hours for a next flight and I had a right to have a refund and at least a hotel room where to stay till the next day. After waiting for 7 hours at the customer service I was told to wait for extra 2 hours just so they will check if there is any hotel room available.

It was hell, but after problems at the airport check-in and running for life (and plane) I got there. I arrived in Billund at late night and I had to travel to Aalborg by buses until the morning.

First they had a mistake on their website when I booked, causing me to pay for unnecessary priority boarding. At the airport we didn't actually get priority booking because a bus took us to the plane which was full of passengers who didn't pay for priority booking and we boarded after them. When I contacted customer service they refuse to acknowledge the initial mistake so I asked them questions about the new baggage policy which they won't answer directly, but simply copy and paste from the website (I can actually read, thanks). When I explained that I didn't even get the priority boarding that I paid for I get another copy and paste about how they are a non-refundable airline. It's impossible to have a dialogue with the customer service team because there's no way to answer on the same thread that you opened, even when I went through their complicated Contact Us menu, and try to update an existing complaint, the system said that the customer service number I've been given is not valid as it is 7 digits instead of 6.

And I was positively surprised. Having recently flown a major carrier I actually found the Ryanair flight better. Check in is easily done with their mobile app, and it is of course a bit annoying that you have to pay extra to choose your seat. But still a lot better than it used to be when you had to stand in line to get a decent seat. They also have a very good system for cabin luggage. Either you can pay to take it on board, otherwise they only allow a limited number of large cabin bags, the others will be placed in the hold free of charge. This makes boarding much easier, and you can actually find place for your duty free bags and coats in the plane, something that can be almost impossible on other airlines. They now also allow an extra small item, which is far better than they used to be. I was also surprised by the leg room, which was good even for me who is quite tall. Since the seatbacks cannot be reclined you don't end up with someones seatback very close to you. The next surprise was their meal service, where they served good food for low prices. I even manage to find a gluten free meal, which was easy to determine since all items were clearly marked with allergene symbols. The departure was delayed for an hour due to snow in Sweden, and before landing we had to wait more while the runway was cleared from snow. But I found all staff very professional and pleasant. Ryanair used to be an annoying airline with bad passenger service.

"""never had a worse travelling experience""","Budapest to Dublin. I have flown on many different discount airlines, both inside the states and outside mainly in Europe. I've never had a worse travelling experience than with Ryanair. The airline has yet to be on time for flights, and for this trip was delayed both ways significantly. (An hour sitting on the flight to Dublin and already 20 mins to Budapest.) The attendants are rude and unhelpful and do not provide any useful information. For example, telling the cabin the delay is from a attendant who was going home because he's sick instead of the reality that he never showed up, which is what was said earlier. It wasn't that only instance where the staff acted errantly. On the way back to Budapest my fiance and I got belligerently approached by a staff member who demanded to know why our ""Visa Check"" had not been completed and that she didn't have time to check it herself. (Even though we've been waiting in the delayed priority line for the plane for 20 mins). I tried to explain to her that the staff we dropped our luggage off with said we had nothing else to do but go to security. Finally, the website also needs to have a better system of checks when offering other services, like car rental. My fiance and I rented and paid for a car in Dublin, knowing that an extra fee is often charged to people under 25. The site gave no indication that this wasn't taken in account for, or that there was an issue with our rental. When we showed up the company would not give us a car, and did not offer us a way to contact the airline for a refund.

"""worst airline customer service""","Stansted to Limoges. Possibly the worst airline customer service. As I checked in the agent handed me back my boarding pass and travel documents but kept my passport by mistake. By the time I realized it was missing, I was at the gate but with 40mins to spare till the flight went. I though a simple phone call to the check in agent would solve the issue. First there was no signs of any Ryanair staff at the gate. Only Swissport agents who could not care less about my issue. I had to insist for them to ring the check in desk. The agent acknowledged they had my passport. However they would not bring it back to me. I had to go get it myself. The gate being the furthest away meant a 20 min run both way. In short there was no way I could exit security and return to the gate on time to catch my flight. I asked them if they could wait for me for a few extra minutes rather than offloading my bags. Their answer was no, and the gate will be closing soon too. Any airline who respect their passengers would have had the passport rushed to the gate on time by one of their staff. Especially so since it was the check in staff fault.  As a result I ended up missing my flight and best of all I had to pay a re-booking fee of 100 pounds, even though it was the check in staff fault. I also had to book a room at the airport hotel which cost me another 100 pounds. I did wrote to Ryanair about the issue and other than standards letter of apologies explaining that they can't be held responsible for the agents lack of support they were not prepared to cover any extra cost involved.

I talked to support for almost an hour, and they're still talking to me while I type this review because they're claiming that after the booking was ""cancelled"" they tried my card several more times until it was successful. Now that would have been perfectly fine if I was told that my card was continuously being tried as the payment method; or I was told when my card worked and that I would have been charged the money. In either of those cases I would not have spent more money in order to buy a new ticket from a different airline. Support also claimed that they have ""no cancellation policy"" - which is not even the situation right now. I'm only looking for a refund on the ticket that was presumably ""cancelled"" which still charged my credit card - which they say they ""cannot do anything about"".

"""Ryanair behaved so unprofessionally""","My two friends and I were very unlucky to fly with Ryanair during the mass strike in France this October. We were supposed to fly from Alicante to Kaunas on the 10th of October, but when we arrived to the airport it appeared that our flight was delayed. We waited for ages, then they put us to the plane, where we waited further. Then they returned us back to the airport and said that our flight was canceled due to the strike in France. Not delayed but canceled! Now we only had the option of getting back our money (which was ridiculous, since with this little money we could not possibly buy a flight with another company) or waiting while Ryanair offers us something else. We chose the last variant since we are pensioners and don't have spare money, and we especially chose Ryanair because they offer the lowest prices. We stood in the biggest queue for the whole night! Thank goodness there were 3 of us and we could substitute one another. Throughout the night Ryanair never offered us even a bottle of water! When it was finally our turn to apply for a change of flight, Ryanair offered us a flight for the 18th October! They were only were willing to pay for one night's stay for us (and this chance had already passed since that was the night we spent in the queue). How we were supposed to live until the 18th October in a foreign country apparently did not concern them. Since we needed to go to Kaunas (Lithuania) we finally managed to board a plane going to Poznan (Poland) which was the closest destination to Kaunas and flew with it. I must say that Ryanair behaved so unprofessionally through the whole situation. Not to offer water to the passengers was the last drop really.

"""Ryanair service is bad""","Glasgow to Sofia. My flight was delayed for 3hrs, I was stuck at the airport and waited. By the time I got to my destination, Sofia it was past midnight. Metro has stopped running, the only way to get into the city centre was via taxi. Since I’m a budget traveler, I didn’t want to waste money on the taxi, so I decided to sleep at the airport and wasted the money for the night of hostel I booked. A day or 2 after, I got an email about flight delays, and only just found out that there was an EU law that any flight delays for 3 hrs and more, the customer is entitled to a claim. I immediately submitted the claim. About a week later, Ryanair rejected my claim, saying my delay was under 3 hrs! Well, the flight was delayed 3 hrs exactly, we didn’t board until 3 hrs later, but it could have landed less than 3 hrs later, which I wouldn’t know, because I didn’t check the exact time I landed, it could be about 2hr 50min later than expected in Sofia. Ryanair also said, any flights that are delayed more than 1.5hr, customers are entitled to claim back expenses during the wait at the airport, providing receipts are provided. At the same time, they closed my case. I took this as a complaint, I asked for the exact time it landed in Sofia; asked for the reason of the delay; explained due to the delay, I lost a night at the hostel, and had to explain to them that I had to sleep at the airport; and why no one informed us there would be spending expenses for delays over 1.5hr?  When I got a reply from Ryanair, the staff was not even answering any of my questions, he just repeated the same thing as the first person said, told me to submit any receipts. Also that the flight was delayed for less than 3 hrs, so I was entitled to the 3hr+ claim. I tried again, explaining this further, but once again, it was no use. They were not doing anything about it. I just wanted to warn anyone flying around Europe, if there’re any delays, make sure you check the time, and make a record of it if possible. You can always get it from the website afterwards and save a record for it, if you need any claims. If it’s delayed for less than 3 hrs, check the airline’s policy and see what you’re entitled to. Because obviously they would not just tell you the freebies you could be entitled to, to save their cost! Anyway, Ryanair service is bad, all the emails I had with them back and forth, they were terrible.

By then, any faith we might have had in Ryanair was pretty well dispelled and we had no high hopes of the flights themselves. In the event everything went fairly smoothly. Boarding for the outward flight was handled efficiently by a single agent while the cabin crew were both pleasant and hardworking. The cabin manager, in particular, carried out her duties very responsibly (for example, not starting the safety demonstration until she was sure that she had the attention of practically everyone on board) but with good humour. There was some changing of seats before we departed, but we were only a few minutes late rolling back. We arrived early (cue the awful triumphal blast) after an uneventful journey. For the return flight, boarding was slightly delayed though it did not impact upon our actual departure time. The cabin crew again worked hard but it was difficult to hear any of their announcements, due to the speed with which they were made plus the conversation level within the cabin. The actual flight was equally uneventful and we arrived marginally early, so we had the trumpet blast again, which this time was greeted by ironic cheers. After all the various alarms beforehand, therefore, we made it there and back without any real bother, but my wife and I have still decided that we will do our best to avoid Ryanair in the future. How can you trust a company that changes the rules after you have booked, yet denies it has done so, or cancels flights on a whim and tries to wriggle out of any of the consequences? My overall rating here therefore balances out the pluses of the actual flights against the minuses of the doubts and uncertainties beforehand.",book flight ryanair month ago basis price appropriate date goalpost move later need pay seat order ensure wife sit later cancellation farrago throw holiday doubt ryanair force publish list flight affect learn flight day fly receive email warning ban carry alcohol cabin tell happen alcohol buy dutyfree shop affect directly buy dutyfree wonder flight go hen stag party faith ryanair pretty dispel high hope flight event go fairly smoothly boarding outward flight handle efficiently single agent cabin crew pleasant hardworke cabin manager particular carry duty responsibly example start safety demonstration sure attention practically board good humour change seat depart minute late roll arrive early cue awful triumphal blast uneventful journey return flight boarding slightly delay impact actual departure time cabin crew work hard difficult hear announcement speed plus conversation level cabin actual flight equally uneventful arrive marginally early trumpet blast time greet ironic cheer alarm real bother wife decide good avoid ryanair future trust company change rule book deny cancel flight whim try wriggle consequence overall rating balance plus actual flight minus doubt uncertainty,0.0014777673641219735,0.08363868296146393,0.22755371034145355,0.016028830781579018,0.06387346982955933,0.37579023838043213,0.23163726925849915,Topic_6
"""had a pleasant flight back""","Liverpool to Dublin. My partner and myself flew to Dublin for a day out. After going through the booking system online and reading some of the reviews online we were not looking forward to the flight. The booking system is quite obviously setup to seat people as far apart as possible so the priority seating charge can be applied to sit together, this method leaves you with a feeling of being ripped off, a fact born out in most reviews we read. I personally would prefer the £3 to be automatically applied to the fare with an option to be randomly seated for £3 less, this would leave you feeling you had a bargain instead and cut down complaints and as most people prefer to travel together the airline would probably make more from it and everyone would be happy. We recieved 3 reminder emails from ryanair prompting us to check in online and avoid the airport checkin charge which was good. We were pleasantly surprised by the flights, both journeys were on time and even landed ahead of schedule. The planes were clean and looked new and the staff were proffessional and curtious. At dublin after dropping our hire car we underestimated the time it would take to get through security as it was very busy and by the time we got through our gate was closed. After a mad run the full length of terminal 1 we got to the gate 10 minutes before take off with the gate deserted. However after jumping up and down and waving to the pilots who we could see through the windows, he instructed one of the ground crew to come and get us and bring us to the plane, cant thank him enough.

"""will not be flying with Ryanair again""","Liverpool to Prague. Booked with Ryanair despite all the recent bad publicity and were lucky to not have our flights cancelled. Thought we had paid for seats next to each other on the flight out but the transaction mustn't have completed as I ended up in seat 8d and my husband was sat in 32d. Rather a dramatic difference, but then I suppose that is how they rinse you of more money! I'd come to terms with not taking a suitcase for a whopping £80 return, so I had squashed my stuff into a little hand suitcase and was happy with the fact you had no waiting time at the other end for your case. Unfortunately, as we got to the gate to board the plane, I was told my little case was to go into the hold for free as there were now more than 90 passengers with hand luggage! But it didn't get whisked off by a memeber of staff, oh no, I had to carry it down the steps, and put the thing on the suitcase truck myself! Once aboard the plane and once we realised that our seats were at the other end of the plane, I sat down in my seat and crossed my fingers for a good flight out in between all the stag and hen dos shouting to one another as none of them were sat next to each other either! Makes sense that doesn't it! So we set off on time and the cabin crew have to ask 4 times for everyone to shut up while they carry out the safety demonstration. Four times they got ignored! Throughout the flight, the toilet queue was always 10 people deep, the cabin crew were abused left right and centre by the passengers but eventually we landed safely. Peeved that I had to the stand in another queue waiting for my suitcase, having purposely not spend £80 for the pleasure of not having to wait for it, we stood waiting for 10mins to pick it up. The flight home was much quieter, much smoother and minus so many hen and stags. We paid the extra £4.08 for my husband to sit in front of me and someone kindly offered to swap so we could sit together.

"""horrifically awful""","Glasgow to Dublin. Absolutely horrifically awful. We got some warnings on this airline, and I wish I had heeded them. It's true that they have the best price initially, but they have so many hidden costs it's obscene and I really feel strongly that a reputable airline is the way to go. I will never fly with Ryanair again. The staff member we met to check in was the rudest person I had ever dealt with in customer service - I don't even know how to describe it, the whole interaction left me in a very sour mood - she informed us that because we had not done the online checkin two hours before our flight (we were standing in front her 1 hour and 45 minutes before our flight, without exaggeration), we now had to pay £100 to have her check us in. This was more than both our tickets combined. It was 6:30 in the morning, and we were the only ones there. I couldn't believe it. The next lady we spoke to who was charging us this fee advised that we had 'checked our email wrong' since there should have been a reminder (there wasn't- I went back and checked, even the junk box). The booking email does mention this fee at the end of the page. If this airline wants to save money by limiting staff and doing things online, I support that - but I should have still been able to check in myself then at that time - to cut off the online checkin 2 hours before and charge a ridiculous fee at that time is just shady, wrong and I felt so angry. They already have additional costs for everything - we had paid to check our bags, and we had paid extra for 'priority' seating so our seats were already reserved - so why would we check in??? So angry and disappointed. The worst part is, this airline clearly does not care about what their customers think, and that makes the customer totally powerless to ensure that the service they're receiving is fair, and this case it's not.

The flight was smooth and everything went without delay.

"""Crew attentive as always""","My longest Ryanair sector so far, considering I have flown many times with them before. If you play by the rules, and do as they say you get a cheap flight that's usually comfortable and on time. Using Stansted for this, the gate was far away from the terminal which is fine. Having bought priority boarding, I was one of the first to board but somehow that doesn't matter, just be at the front of the regular queue and you'll save a few quid in the process. Only 90 carry on's can be placed in the overhead locker so I asked for mine to be placed in the hold, gate staff are more often than not happy to assist in that matter when they are asked. Bag tag goes on and I left my suitcase with a baggage handler. Onboard the aircraft was with the old Ryanair cabin on one of their oldest Boeing 737-800 although, she didn't look it. The majority of the Ryanair fleet have the older, more padded seats in a 189Y configuration so good if you're a little larger, like myself. The newer in the fleet with the Boeing Sky Interior have the lighter-weight seating which has far less padding but more legspace although I cannot vouch for that. The seat was comfortable and legspace was okay although another inch would of been beneficial for all 6"" of me. Crew attentive as always passing through the cabin twice on this three hour flight providing a refreshments service which I find to be overpriced so buy before hand in the airport where you'll save money. Crew also passed through the cabin with some perfumes, electronic items and the famous Ryanair scratchcard. Onboard was rather warm but the flight was near enough full so that's to be expected. A comfortable crossing. A smooth landing into Sofia and we parked on a remote stand. Bussed to the terminal on a sweltering old bus into Terminal 2, the better of the two terminals. Ryanair being one of the few low cost carriers to use Terminal 2. Passport control was smooth with border police just visually checking my passport while there was a short delay with getting my bag on the carousel. Returning was a similar affair. The gate staff at Sofia look for oversize bags at the gate so please be warned in carrying oversized bags not to the restrictions. They were also checking for oversized second carry on bags too. I asked for my suitcase to be placed in the hold which the obliged. The flight was delayed 40 minutes due to a delay with the inbound aircraft; something that does happen from time to time with the last flights of the day with Ryanair. I slept for most of the flight home onboard a full flight. Air-conditioning was on although it was rather warm onboard and I slept comfortably for such a small space. A quick left hand turn onto short finals ensured a smooth landing into London Stansted. Parked on a remote stand again and was bussed on an old London bendy bus to the terminal where my bag was waiting on the carousel. If you do as your told and play by the rules, you will get a cheap flight. Book ahead in advance and it will be cheap too. If wanting to travel with luggage, the daily BA offering from London Heathrow might be a cheaper option when travel to airport costs are included.

"""overall positive experience""
",This was a very early morning flight from Madrid to Toulouse. I was able to check-in online and found the bag-drop to be efficient and reasonably quick too. There was quite a long wait at the departure gate and this is where things were poorly managed. Boarding was not well organised at all.

"""didn't we regret flying this airline""","We fly a lot. We have flown with the best, Etihad, Cathay, Singapore Airlines, Emirates etc. We have also flown with many budget airlines around the world. We can now say we have flown with what must be, the worst airline on earth. We were in the middle of a cruise with no internet. We docked at Ibiza and went for a coffee. Whilst there we got internet access and received an email from Ryanair saying if we didn't check in, we could be charged $50 Euro each. To our disbelif, we tried to check in online but at the final stage, we were kicked out of the website. We tried several times. At that time there was a global virus effecting everywhere and our search engine Google was not allowing us to access many websites. We were in the Ryanair website but could not complete the check-in. We eventually gave up and decided to try later. Our next stop was Palma where we departed the ship. As we did not have internet access, we decided to get to the airport early so we could hopefully complete check-in well before the 2 hour window Ryanair gives. We arrived at Palma airport 2 hours and 40 minutes before our flight. We waiting in the check-in queue for around 25 minutes. When we finally were called we explained to the check-in lady that we could not check-in as their website wold not let us complete the checkin the day before. She then went out of her way to try and check us in on our mobile phone. She gave us the thumbs up, but then she must have had the same problem. She tried again but could not check us in on our phone. With 8 minutes before the the 2 hour window, she gave up and said sorry you have 8 minutes good luck. We tried but could not check in on time. Then we went back to the check-in counter and the lady gave us a docket to go to the service counter to pay the $100 Euro ($50 x 2). We walked to the service counter and stood in line for another 15 minutes. We paid $100 Euro because we had no option. When we originally booked this flight, we had other options and wow didn't we regret flying this airline. Whilst waiting in the check-in queue and the service counter queue we heard complaint after complaint about the service/procedures. When we boarded the plane, we saw the seats and could not believe our eyes. The tightest seating I have ever seen, including all the Asian airlines. Scattered crumbs, loose hair and rubbish on just about every seat. I brushed the food off our seat and then thought to take a photo. I wished I took the photo before? When you view the seat photo, the yellow is the head rest of the seat in front. This will show how tight the seats are. The plane looked dirty. As we sat down we heard a lady with a British accent discuss the lack of baggage storage. She had a small bag. The Ryanair stewardess said ""bad luck, take your seat"". The lady passenger yelled ""Typical Ryanair"" The photos attached show the condition of the plane. The seating stunk, worn leather. So on top of an extra $100 Euro we flew the longest hour of our lives and were counting the seconds to get off. Thankfully there were no more dramas after we landed. Do not fly this airline. The response from Ryanair was a standard reply and we could tell they did not read our email.

But, the gift vouchers expired during the time it took them to refund my money, so I guess that money is just lost.

Outbound was on time but return was delayed 30 minutes due to a combination of Stansted passenger delays and a strong head wind giving a rather lumpy ride on an older aircraft.

"""I would fly again with Ryanair""","I travelled Edinburgh to Barcelona on Feb 3rd 2017 returning on Feb 7th 2017. The outbound flight was early in the day however was ideal as you got an extra day in Barcelona. Return flight again was ideal, as you got home at a reasonable time. I booked extra leg room seats, 2D was my seat for both flights. With that you got priority boarding. Extra legroom was excellent, I'm 5'11 with back problems and I found this seat comfy and could straighten my leg out full with passengers who sit in 2D/E can get past me without hassling me. So I recommend anyone flying with RyanAir to do this! I would like a bit more cushion for your bottom. Priority boarding is good, as you don't wait in the normal queue, however its annoying when you are boarded first, and everyone is trying to get past you to get to their seat, and are hitting you with their bags etc. However great for you when you land, you are off first. One thing on the baggage, is on the Ryanair website they sound like they are strict with the baggage allowance. I noticed many people having 'bigger' bags getting on the plane okay, no questions asked. Thought that was a bit unfair considering I had cabin bag size. Mobile boarding, love it!

"""a good experience, for the price""","I have flown with Ryanair very often over the last few months from Edinburgh and Glasgow down to London. The aircraft are clean. The flights are on time and the prices are ridiculously cheap. You can get Edinburgh to London single from £9.99 if you book early. I find the staff on board tend to be very pleasant and helpful. The seat is fine, it is certainly not the most comfortable ever but given that they only do short flights this is fine. The only slight annoyance is that there is no seatback pocket to put anything in. Overall I would recommend them highly, I think that the value is much better than BA. Ryanair do not charge for a credit card payment, BA charge £5. Ryanair are more frequently on time in my experience, and the prices are often around 1/8 of BA prices. No contest I would choose Ryanair. Stansted as an airport is fine, the security was better before they meddled with it, the staff can be rude, but this is the same for anywhere, the main problem is that other passengers at Stansted are just awful, but once you've been a few times you find the quiet seating areas away from everyone else.

"""exorbitant on-board prices""","Manchester to Alicante return. The outward flight was punctual and I had an empty seat beside me - always useful as you can twist sideways and gain a little extra comfort. The inflight service was poor. As seats on Ryanair do not have pockets, the price list in contained in their magazine. On this occasion, none was offered. Instead, cabin crew simply started selling. I asked for the list and was astonished to find the prices expressed in euros. When I questioned this, the steward told me that this was because Ryanair was an Irish airline. When I asked what the conversion rate to sterling was, I was told it was roughly the same. Crews are now equipped with handheld calculators. I was 'allowed' to pay in sterling, but, when I asked what the exchange rate was, was simply told 'Ryanair's own'. So, to sum up: lack of transparent/any visible pricing, exorbitant on-board prices - and not even a half-melted ice cube in sight! Why can't the CAA set some basic standards and sort Ryanair out once and for all? We know the fares are cheap, but that shouldn't be an excuse for trying to bamboozle people. And certainly a price cap is needed for printing boarding passes at the airport. The flight back was in complete contrast: well-dressed cabin crew, girls made up immaculately, good piloting and on-time landing. Needless to say, this time I didn't try to buy anything on board.

I bought priority boarding, priority security (Fast Track) and priority seat assignments. That made the experience tolerable. However, Stansted Airport was a disaster, and I would never again fly out of there. Add to the unbelievably large Duty Free Area the fact that a gate is not assigned until about 40 minutes prior to departure. That is unforgivable - that leaves scant little time to get to that gate. In our case, the single escalator leading up to the Gate 40-59 waiting area was out of service, so 180 passengers per flight times 19 gates meant over 3400 people were trying to ascend a single staircase. The obvious fire-hazard aside, it meant a crush of humanity in the passageway and an exceptionally long transit time from the hub to the gate. The only reason I can see for this is to keep the passengers in the shopping/dining area as long as possible. Rome Ciampino, on the other hand, is a dump, but quickly navigated.

"""everything went very smoothly""","First time on Ryanair for at least ten years and it took the availability of direct flights to the north of Spain to attract us back. We took the business plus option and, while more expensive, it was certainly cheaper than any other option on any route to the same area. We were certainly happy with the service through Edinburgh airport, although there didn't appear to be a dedicated business plus desk available, but the fast track through security and the early boarding were very welcome. Flight departure was scheduled for 6.55am and by 6.25 we were standing outside the airport buildings at the head of a long queue waiting for boarding. This is probably the worst part of flying with Ryanair and such as passengers may be exposed to the elements for quite some time waiting to board, thankfully on this particular morning it was dry, not too cold and bearable. The crew appeared about 6.30 and by 6.40 we were in our seats watching the oncoming passengers in what appeared to be a full load struggling to find overhead locker space and, some their seats. Departure was delayed by half an hour for air traffic control purposes but, once airborne everything went very smoothly and I managed to catch up with some sleep on the way. Cabin crew were friendly, informative and appeared to meet all the needs expected of them by passengers. The return trip was somewhat similar although check-in in Santander was through normal processes, i.e. we all queued up for two desks and took our turn with everybody else to check-in our bags, there was no special service for business plus but that was not a problem as the staff at the desks were quite efficient. Again, the wait outside for boarding, this time in nice sunshine, aboard in plenty of time and airborne exactly on schedule. A newer aircraft this time with the more modern Boeing cabin lighting etc. Good service from the crew and this time we availed ourselves of the excellent coffee and a croissant at an acceptable price. Flight was very smooth and arrival in Edinburgh some fifteen minutes early.

The staff on the plane are generally unhelpful and unfriendly, the staff on the ground are the same and you can add ""look disinterested"". I have been a regular traveller for 18 years and I will try to be impartial so I must say they are generally on time.

I saw the Ryanair help desk and it was like talking to a brick wall - no facial expression, not a care or desire to help. I had my Irish driving licence with photo id and my address on the card, but they said it needs to be a passport which they know I had stolen.

"""Ryanair, shame on you""","Cork to Lanzarote. I am writing a review on behalf of my partially sighted 76 year old mother, who flew alone on flight FR9943 from Cork to Lanzarote on the 8th of Sept. 2016 to meet other family members who were already holidaying there. My mother who also suffers from a chronic back problem can not walk quickly, nor can she walk long distances requested wheelchair assistance and a person to walk her on to the aircraft to find her seat as she is incapable of reading seat numbers due to her sight. All this information is clearly stated on the boarding pass. EASY, SIMPLE, wouldn't you think, not so for Ryanair, my mother was wheeled to the departure gate area and left there. Eventually after a period of time she managed to make her own way to the departure desk to inquire what was going on. The person there literally man handled my mother and ran her down the gangway onto the aircraft dropped her luggage on to a seat and left just as the flight was about to leave. There was not one member of cabin crew helped my mother, other passengers on the flight helped her to find her seat, she put her luggage on the floor as she would be totally unable to put it in the overhead locker. As any traveller would image, a very uncomfortable 4 hour flight with luggage taking up the small space where your feet should be. On arrival at Lanzarote, she and another passenger with need of assistance were left waiting at the exit door of the aircraft for a very long time (I don't know exactly how long but it was certainly long enough for family to start worrying and try to find her, afraid that they had somehow miss her).

"""very good value for money""","Flew Ryanair Manchester to Barcelona return on 4th August and back on 18th August. I had never flown with Ryanair before, and was not expecting much with it being a low-cost airline. Entering the terminal (Manchester T3) we were annoyed to see that Ryanair checks in all their flights at the same counters, and that there was a huge queue, stretching all the way to the cafés nearby. We arrived two hours before the flight and the check in queue took over an hour and obviously we were worried about missing our flight. After getting through check in and security we were running to catch the flight even after being sent to the front of the line in security, thankfully we made it. Upon entering the aircraft (B737-800) I was shocked at how crammed the plane was with seats, the legroom was barely big enough to get to the seat (middle) in the first place, but for a 2 hour flight I could manage. After departure we were handed a magazine with a menu inside. The menu was basic and quite overpriced, but I was hungry so I bought a buttered croissant and a tea (same on the way back) for €3. The flight attendants were kind, attentive and efficient and I received my food very quickly. The food was tasty and the croissant had been warmed. There was a little turbulence on the way, and my tea sloshed a little on me, and the flight attendant quickly helped me clean it up with a smile. After landing in Barcelona we had to wait 25 minutes for our bags to arrive. On the way back to Manchester two weeks later we were cautious and arrived at the airport 2h 30m before the flight instead, but check in and security were very fast and we spent nearly 2 hours in departures, and with big glass windows this was great for me, being an avid plane spotter. The gate was surprisingly in arrivals, and therefore we had to go through security again to get to the plane. After waiting for 20 minutes to board we, along with everyone else were directed towards arrivals, rather than towards the plane, which ended up in a big confusion for the airport staff. Like on the way, the attendants were attentive and kind and although we had major problems with ground staff the airline is very good value for money, and I would recommend it for those who do not have much money to spend on their flight, although if there is a flight with a different airline with a similar price, I'd pick the other.",fly ryanair manchester barcelona return th august th august fly ryanair expect lowcost airline enter terminal manchester t annoyed ryanair check flight counter huge queue stretch way cafés nearby arrive hour flight check queue take hour obviously worried miss flight get check security run catch flight send line security thankfully enter aircraft b shock cram plane seat legroom barely big seat middle place hour flight manage departure hand magazine menu inside menu basic overpriced hungry buy butter croissant tea way flight attendant kind attentive efficient receive food quickly food tasty croissant warm little turbulence way tea slosh little flight attendant quickly help clean smile land barcelona wait minute bag arrive way manchester week later cautious arrive airport h m flight instead check security fast spend nearly hour departure big glass window great avid plane spotter gate surprisingly arrival security plane wait minute board direct arrival plane end big confusion airport staff like way attendant attentive kind major problem ground staff airline good value money recommend money spend flight flight different airline similar price d pick,0.0014693986158818007,0.029098445549607277,0.11920624226331711,0.03819233924150467,0.022889910265803337,0.5756721496582031,0.21347156167030334,Topic_6

We sat on the tarmac for a further hour without a single follow up message from the pilot. We never heard again from the pilots at all throughout the entire journey even once we had landed. At East Midlands, the doors were opened and we were then advised that no ground-crew were available to unload the plane so we again waited on the tarmac for a further 10 minutes.

"""consistent changing of goal posts""","Liverpool to Nimes. I'm happy with Ryanair's budget approach, but over many years of using their flights there's been a consistent changing of goal posts that inevitably disadvantages the customer. These do not seem to be writ large all over their website. My latest encounter involved printing boarding passes. I do both the mobile and the printed- belt n braces kind of approach. I was printing the passes from saved pdf files which displayed all images and the barcode perfectly. The boarding passes printed beautifully except for the barcodes. I altered every possible parameter on the printer, even printing as a super-fine image, with the same outcome ie perfect adverts, lovely table for the barcode info, crisp text, but the barcode a grayed-out blur or totally absent. I went online to their 'chat' - 'well i don't know change your printer' : I phoned customer service - 'use a different browser' - nobody else boarding that flight has had this problem so it's your fault'. Being an OCD sort I actually scrutinised the pretty-looking boarding pass I printed. Unlike earlier iterations, the barcode is now a smaller element of a foldable page stacked with big, colourful adverts. Many users may glance at this and not notice that the barcode is wonky or absent. Most customers will now, I guess, be using the mobile app. Which means that it looks like Ryanair have spotted a niche market represented by the digital divide - ie, if you aren't technically aware, and don't own a smartphone, you'll get 'fined' at check-in. Be interesting to see if any other customers have also experienced this. It interests me that in neither of my encounters with customer advice did the operative advise me to use the mobile app instead - which is the logical answer. In both encounters it was the usual Ryanair indifference plus assigning blame to 'stupid customers'.",liverpool nime m happy ryanairs budget approach year flight s consistent changing goal post inevitably disadvantage customer writ large website late encounter involve print boarding pass mobile print belt n brace kind approach print pass save pdf file display image barcode perfectly boarding pass print beautifully barcode alter possible parameter printer print superfine image outcome ie perfect advert lovely table barcode info crisp text barcode grayedout blur totally absent go online chat not know change printer phone customer service use different browser boarding flight problem fault ocd sort actually scrutinise prettylooke boarding pass print unlike early iteration barcode small element foldable page stack big colourful advert user glance notice barcode wonky absent customer guess mobile app mean look like ryanair spot niche market represent digital divide ie not technically aware not smartphone ll fine checkin interesting customer experience interest encounter customer advice operative advise use mobile app instead logical answer encounter usual ryanair indifference plus assign blame stupid customer,0.0016898754984140396,0.06760548055171967,0.35054662823677063,0.13481827080249786,0.017677515745162964,0.3189582824707031,0.10870400816202164,Topic_3

"""very satisfied with Ryanair""","Prague to London Stansted with Ryanair. I have flown on this route about 6 times this year and have consistently been very satisfied with Ryanair. There are 3 other budget airlines which I could choose but Ryanair's fares are always the cheapest. They allow a cabin bag plus another small bag (e.g. laptop), which is generous for a budget airline. They boast about a 90% on time arrival (within an hour), and given my experiences I can believe it. I have been delayed once and that was because all flights were grounded due to weather. The staff are fine, friendly enough. Boarding can be a bit chaotic, and I would recommend paying the small fee for priority boarding (note that this does sell out, so do it at time of booking rather than a later add-on). Personally I don't care about in-flight entertainment, magazines, or drink services, so I won't make any judgement based on those (which is good, because they are either non-existent, or average at best). If you want a good trip here is what to bear in mind. Have expectations that match the price - this is a budget airline that tries to deliver best price by having no-frills. Read the rules and stick to them. Cabin bag dimensions are a bit smaller than usual which can catch you out. Only 20cm width as opposed to normal 25cm. Would have caught me out once but fortunately they didn't check bags at the gate. Be sure to check in online prior to arriving at the airport. They do not have check in desks, and if you haven't checked in you are setting yourself up for a hefty penalty. Only the first 90 bags will be boarded, the rest will be put into the hold free of charge. This means that if you insist on carrying your bag, you will have to queue up at the gate to make sure you are one of the earlier passengers to board. If you sit down and wait, go for a coffee or whatever, and then board later, you are not taking your bag on board. The only thing I wish they would change is to remove the bright yellow colour scheme from the cabin. Maybe it's branding, but it just lends a tackiness to the whole experience that seems unnecessary. I am sure they could adjust their brand to something slightly more tasteful. Overall I have to give them top marks. I am not sure they are the best choice for families with small children, but if you're a single traveller or a non-fussy couple/group, and you want to get from A to B cheaply, you won't beat them (on this route, at least).",prague london stanste ryanair fly route time year consistently satisfied ryanair budget airline choose ryanair fare cheap allow cabin bag plus small bag eg laptop generous budget airline boast time arrival hour give experience believe delay flight ground weather staff fine friendly boarding bit chaotic recommend pay small fee priority boarding note sell time booking later addon personally not care inflight entertainment magazine drink service will not judgement base good nonexistent average good want good trip bear mind expectation match price budget airline try deliver good price have nofrill read rule stick cabin bag dimension bit small usual catch cm width oppose normal cm catch fortunately not check bag gate sure check online prior arrive airport check desk not check set hefty penalty bag board rest hold free charge mean insist carry bag queue gate sure early passenger board sit wait coffee board later take bag board thing wish change remove bright yellow colour scheme cabin maybe branding lend tackiness experience unnecessary sure adjust brand slightly tasteful overall mark sure good choice family small child single traveller nonfussy couplegroup want b cheaply will not beat route,0.001361830742098391,0.1802287995815277,0.08482189476490021,0.014775367453694344,0.007554170675575733,0.4161745011806488,0.2950834035873413,Topic_6
"""a passing grade for short flights""","As part of our 3 week visit to the UK and Ireland, our group of 3 planned to fly to Dublin from London, and from Dublin to Glasgow. I knew Ryanair was a budget airline and to watch for the extras. I had no problem with the booking and even though we didn't pre-select our seats for a fee, when we checked in on-line, we were assigned seats together anyway, on both flights. Check-in at Dublin was chaotic. We had no way to print our boarding passes and they were not downloadable. Not knowing there was a place to print them at the airport, we were reprimanded by the attendant at the bag drop but she printed them for us anyway. The boarding on both flights was somewhat chaotic. Again, we didn't bother to pay for priority boarding (why bother); but one of the flights didn't even have a plane at the gate, and we were herded like sheep into waiting buses which drove out on the tarmac to a waiting plane. Both flights were boarded out on the tarmac, climbing stairs to the plane. The FA's were all friendly enough but the head FA's making the announcements were difficult to understand (they weren't Irish).

Checked luggage no bother, they even took one of our carry on for free at check in - happy days. The boarding was efficient, jammed up a bit once we were on the plane, but otherwise it was fine. They took another carry on bag from us at the gate. We pushed back on time, and were airborne shortly after. I indulged in some nuts and a coke. And had brought a bite with me from the airport, so that was my main meal. The selection on board is good but pricey. To my dismay, they no longer have the Trip magazines that they had had on my previous flights. The crew were very attentive. We arrived a few minutes ahead of schedule which was great. We disembarked and got our luggage no bother. I would put them way ahead of every other European budget carrier, and maybe even ahead of a few other mainline airlines.

It's amazing how much the airline's customer service has improved in recent years, particularly with their allocated seating, extra cabin baggage allowance, use of primary airports and excellent mobile app, features, all of which, have significantly enhanced the overall travel experience. In addition, it is pleasing to see that Ryanair have begun using satellite 2 in Stansted for some of their flights, which offers a far more relaxed boarding experience, along with much more space and seating compared to satellite 3 (which is the main gate area from which Ryanair flights operate). Ryanair should definitely consider making more use of this facility, as it is very underused and often empty for long periods of the day. (In fact, there were only 3 flights operating from there when we flew out). Onboard, I noticed that service has improved too, and there are no longer as many tedious announcements as before, particularly on evening flights. On both flights, cabin crew were very friendly and professional. Clearly, Ryanair have come a long way since their improvement plan started, and I wouldn't hesitate to fly with them again.

"""seats rather numbing after a couple of hours""","Opted for Ryanair to fly Liverpool to Malaga and back rather than preferred easyJet on grounds of timings and price. Booked the return flight separately as paying in euros saved money, even using my credit card. Had problems trying to check in online as our computer does not seem to like the new Ryanair website and in the end could only do so via the old so-called Legacy website, only to discover that airport security and boarding gates struggle to read the boarding codes. Outward flight was fine and everyone seemed to get their hand luggage on board despite the flight being full. The return journey was less satisfactory. It was delayed by an hour with no explanation or apology given. Boarding at Malaga was in 3 groups: priority first, then rows 22 - 33, then everyone else. We could see that it made sense to board the back rows first when using an airbridge, but some prior warning would have been helpful as the existence of the display notices indicates that it is Ryanair policy. Then as the rest of us were boarded, the boarding agents immediately began to tag our cabin baggage for free hold storage without any warning, which necessitated extracting items wanted on board as we waited beyond the gate. It seemed that there must have been a pre-determined number of passengers to be selected for hand luggage removal as those at the back of the queue were allowed to keep their bags. In fact, as there was a large school party on board with minimal hand luggage, there would have been plenty of room for everyone's bags. We couldn't help feeling unfairly treated as we were near the front in the original queue, but relegated towards the rear and then selected for baggage extraction as well. The flight itself was ok, though we do find Ryanair seats rather numbing after a couple of hours.

We sat near the back of the plane and had the three seats to ourselves. I really like the seat allocation as this has completely eliminated the mad rush that I remember. We didn't have anything to eat or drink as it was a short flight but we did buy our coach tickets from the FA and saved a few pounds. All staff encountered throughout were very friendly and helpful.

When the bus came and we are about to board priority staff again stopped me and asked me again, ""are you in priority?"" I did have priority boarding but not on the plane, but only on the bus that transported us to board the plane. So when boarding the plane, we still boarded as usual in a long queue. The seat onboard is normal and I was sitting in the front row near an aisle, which was really annoying as the corridor was so small and people kept going to the toilet located just in front of my seat, and therefore, I could not enjoy the ""long leg room"" as the space is just too small.

"""very pleasant staff""","Flew Birmingham to Dublin with Ryanair, have never been on one of these flights that hasn't been at least 90% full, this time around 50% as extra flights had been laid on for Cheltenham and this was one of the flights going back to Dublin near empty which made for a very relaxing experience. I fly this route several times a month and usually default to Aer Lingus as they can be cheaper if planned and booked in advance. This time fares on both airlines were exorbitant thanks to St Patrick's Day and the Cheltenham Festival and Ryanair came out cheaper. Brand new 737 with new interior and the very pleasant staff resplendent in their new uniforms. After a very stressful journey to the airport it was lovely to be greeted by such friendly staff, relaxing interior, comfortable seat (I had paid for exit seat for extra leg room so can't comment on the regular seats) and lovely relaxing music. It all felt surreal because our go-to response to anything Ryanair has usually always been negative but this looks like it's set to change. A few years ago, when I had taken my first Ryanair flight in many years I actually laughed at the state of the garish interior but not any more. Why ever did Ryanair not make these changes years ago, I imagine they are going to elicit quite the competitive response from competitors and not just from the no-frills market either. One comment I would always have to make about Ryanair is that although they can be categorised as 'no frills', the same can't be said about being a 'low fares' airline as some of the fares, particularly on this busy route can sometimes resemble long-haul fares.

We received a very short text from Ryanair on the Monday evening to inform us that our flight had been cancelled due to an air traffic control strike in France and a link to rebook our flight. We didn't know what to do at that point. We tried to call their customer service team but could not get an answer - later discovered they all go home at 6pm, because all problems go away at 6pm clearly. We eventually got hold of someone the following morning who told us that they would put us on the next flight to Edinburgh - 6 days later. Having small children at home and a job to go to this was not acceptable. Neither was their insistence that they would not pay for our extra accommodation costs as 'it wasn't their fault'. We discovered that Ryanair were the only airline that cancelled flights due the strike - everyone else just diverted. When we questioned them on this they could not give us any answer. After much discussion, they finally agreed to transfer our booking to a flight from Alicante to Dublin on Thursday (2 days) later however we would then not be able to get a connecting flight to Edinburgh until the Friday morning. On asking if they would put us up for the night in Dublin we were told no, we could keep our receipts and claim back but nothing was gauranteed - as again 'it wasn't their fault'. To add insult to injury, the flight from Dublin to Edinburgh was delayed. We had to pay out for 2 nights accommodation in Spain, a night in Dublin, meals, extra car parking at Edinburgh.

"""very disappointing experience""","Manchester to Faro, and a very disappointing experience. I booked in July for a holiday to Faro in December, party of 4, of which 3 are disabled, 2 of which needed to use the abulift to access the aircraft. I booked special assistance at the time of booking and was allocated specific seats for out party to be able to access easily. We all booked in and went to special assistance area. All fine and good! Well apart from the huge queue that most people with limited diablilities could never stand in to go to bag drop. Flight called, we were taken to board the plane. Wait theres a massive problem, theres 6 people who have disabilities and need the abulift, but we were told Ryanair would only take 4! It seemed 2 others hadn't pre booked assistance but were allocated to board on the abulift. 2 of us in wheelchairs in my party were left on the tarmac whilst the special assistance and Ryanair argued about the fact the pilot wouldn't take more than 4! We got as far as the tarmac, sat for 10 minutes in the freezing cold wind whilst they tried to say we couldnt board. We were totally humiliated asked if we really needed to use the abulift and asked to prove wed booked special assistance, thankfully I always keep the paperwork safe. No other disabled passengers who were elderly were asked. It seems if you are young you can be challenged whether or not you actually need the help.  Ryanair staff would not help and it took one of the special assistance staff to say how ridiculous and bad the situation was, for us to actually get on the plane. We were told shortly before we may not be able to fly as its Ryanair policy that they only take 4 disabled people who cant climb the aircraft stairs. Maybe when Ryanair take your money they should let you know this. 4 people on a whole flight is beyond ridiculous, it does not take into consideration that most people with mobility problems or chronic illness would find it very difficult to climb steps and carry a hand luggage bag, forget those who are confined to a chair.

Headphones provided a welcome layer of isolation. For some reason, on the return flight there was more cabin luggage than could be fitted in the lockers.

In contrast, Ryanair staff were surly and officious. After a pretence at asking for volunteers to have cabin baggage put into the hold 'free of charge' the staff member decided to pick on the middle of a long line. We explained that the child travelling with us was unwell, having been taking Calpol through the day, and asked if she would not transfer our luggage to the hold, especially as our arrival would be late evening. Asked about how long the delay at baggage reclaim would take, the staff member became very officious and suggested we were arguing with her. We had not been asked to give her our boarding passes until she had become very defensive - ""Are you going to give me your boarding passes?"" - when we handed them over immediately. She was obviously having a bad day, and did not transfer anyone else's baggage to the hold after us. We were left to remove valuables and repack our bags. As someone who works in a customer-focused business, I find it hard to believe that staff can get away with rudeness and off-handed comments on a daily basis.

The flight was not completely full so there were few issues with hand luggage and so on, and I like being able to take two bags with me as this saves a great deal of hassle. Downsides were due to Stansted's overcrowding. There is nowhere to sit while you wait for a flight, as they are rebuilding. The security is chaotic and unnecessarily stressful as they have not invested very intelligently in the screening equipment and they have rather bizarrely chosen hardware that increases rather than reduces processing time. Finally we were somewhat kettled in a holding bay near gate 88 by ground crew without explanation before boarding, while another flight disgorged its passengers, and I think it might have been better for Ryanair to send us down a bit later, as some of the families and older passengers grew uncomfortable with nowhere to sit. The Stansted experience is starting to put me off using EasyJet and Ryanair, and I often choose Heathrow and scheduled flights instead.

The best part of the flight was the Spanish cabin crew who were very good/friendly.

"""Don't fly Ryanair""","Flew Ryanair from Birmingham to Dublin in September 2015, flew Business Plus and paid a premium for priority checkin for exit row seats. On arrival, we were advised that we had to checkin at least 2 hours before departure, despite clearly stating that Business Plus fares were excluded from this rule, hence the premium, they than charged 45.00 per person, in total 135 GPB or 297.00 AUD. They wouldn't print the boarding passes until the charged was made to my credit card. We then had to have the seats allocated, at which stage they allocated the same seat to my wife and myself, when we queried, she is no, at which time we advised her to look at the boarding passes, and then she reallocated the seating. On arrival at the gate, we waited in queue under a glass roof which was more like a hothouse, they then open another queue allowing other passengers to board the aircraft, leaving those that had paid the additional fee to wait. It wasn't until the priority boarding queue starting to voice their thoughts that they stopped the other queue boarding. Once onboard, the aircraft seems to be out of the dark ages, excessively old compared to Australian budget airlines. Seats are very narrow and uncomfortable. On seeking a refund for the 135.00, they confirmed the fee was charged incorrectly and would refund. However they wouldn't refund to my credit card, that I would have to wait 3-4 weeks and receive the payment by cheque. I advised that this was not satisfactory and that they should refund the credit to the credit card, at which time they discontinued the conversation and forwarded me to a customer survey.

"""Shame on you Ryanair""",After paying £70.00 return for my Ryanair flight for travelling in June 2015 I was disgusted and dismayed to find that Ryanair have hiked up their prices for exactly the same travel dates in June 2016 to over £200.00 return.

The following is their list of price determining factors : number of passengers already booked on a flight : flight time : Day of travel : time of year - high season/low season etc. Given that we are travelling on the same flights and the same period which have virtually only just become available I fail to see how such a price increase can be justified other than pure greed and the mindset that they have a captive audience.

"""we feel robbed by Ryanair""","Me and my partner booked a last minute holiday to Lanzorote for a week and our only option was to fly with Ryanair as it was short notice and the price we paid for it was decent. We have always booked online and never had an issue with any other airline until it had come to our attention that we had to pay to sit together with was £20 each. At the time we assumed it was because we had booked short notice so we was fine to pay that. However, when we got to the airport (after checking in online a week before ) we were asked to pay £70 each for luggage on the way there and £35 each on the way back! I was so angry as there is nothing that states when you book your holiday that you have to ""check in"" your luggage too? The only question you are asked is if you want to check in ""extra luggage"" - well to me we didn't have extra it was just a standard suitcase and hand luggage (which pretty much everyone takes when they go away). So when you book online that's how they catch you out as they word it wrong by saying extra luggage rather than just a standard luggage. The staff were really abrupt and rude and not really bothered about the hassle this had caused us. Following this, my partner had to ask about luggage on the way back they didn't inform us. Again, there was nothing whilst we were booking to inform us that we had to do this only to check in ""extra luggage"" and I was not aware that my only suitcase had to be classed as extra. Its very misleading!  We normally don't take our bank cards with us on holiday but its a good job we did. To everyone that reads this please take it on board as some people may not be able to afford that kind of money upfront when they charge you which was what happened to the couple in front of us! The staff at the desk said that the information was in the ""small print"" which I think is awful as a vital piece of information like that, in my opinion, should not be in the small print! I have never known so much hassle to go on holiday in all my life and we have booked before with other airlines online and never ever had any issues with luggage. We will never fly with Ryanair again and strongly advise to anyone who is thinking of flying with them to think carefully and go with another airline if you can as you will probably end up paying again what you pretty much paid for the holiday.

"""you realise their service is quite flaky""","This is a review based on my Ryanair experiences at Madrid Barajas airport on 23 September 2015. I arrived 2 hrs early at around 1130 for the 1335 flight. At around 1300 our Boarding Cards were checked and we went down the ramp to embark. At around 1320 we were asked to return to the Departure Lounge due to a technical issue. For the next 3 hrs we were not advised of the issue nor of the plans to get us back to the UK. Gradually over that time people would ask the 2 (relatively junior) staff members of Ryanair and 'news', or lack of it, would filter down the line. No announcements were made. By around 1700 we heard that a plane was on its way and we would depart at around 1930. Ok, 6 hrs delay but at least we'd be home. The 2 officials then handed out photocopies of the EU regulations regarding flight delays etc - useful, but to be honest we just wanted to get home! As can be imagined, people then were asking lots of questions of the 2 lads. At around the same time food vouchers were being handed out and stamped by the 2 officials. However, not one of the food outlets would take the vouchers because Ryanair had tried this in the past and had not paid their bills to the food outlets! At around 1830 the 1930 departure disappeared off the departures list. We heard that another flight had been delayed and our rescue plane had been used for those passengers - presumably to avoid 2 sets of compensation!! Time progressed slowly, we then found out that a flight would take us back to the UK around 2305. The flight actually left at 2330 - 10 hrs late. During the 10 hrs, the 200 or so customers were shunted at least 5 times between Gates - can you imagine 200 people racing around getting from A to B! Ok, these things happen. Lessons to be learnt?  Ryanair, have someone on the ground such as a manager to deal with the situation and inform people officially by adequate communication. Pay your bills to the local food outlets. Having reported all the above, I've travelled extensively for the past few years to Spain and back and used Ryanair a lot. Mostly they are cheap and get you there on time; its just at times such as the above where you realise their service is quite flaky.

"""service is just the worst""","Ryanair seems attractive because of their cheap prices, but their service is pretty lousy. My flight to London was delayed for almost 3 hours; none of the staff at the gate informed us about what was going on and what the reason for the delay was (only when people started walking up to them and asked, everyone kind of found out from the people sitting next to them). Conveniently the flight was delayed just a little under 3 hours so you're not even able to claim a refund. Because of the delay I missed my connecting flight in London (it was already about 8pm), which is why I went to ask for assistance. Their employee was pretty rude and offered no help; she just told me that I booked the two flights at my own risk and that I wasn't gonna get any assistance by Ryanair. Unfortunately there was no flight left to my final destination that day (which I would have had to pay out of my own pocket, of course), which is why I had to book an overnight bus and had a horrible 24hr trip instead of 8 hrs. On my flights back everything luckily went smoothly, but I noticed that boarding was really chaotic at all flights (a woman with her baby in a stroller was pretty much first in line to board and had to wait about 20 mins until all other passengers had boarded to get some help carrying the stroller down the stairs - of course, staff also weren't able to turn on the escalator at least). I wouldn't fly with Ryanair again, because despite their (in my case not even that cheap) prices their service is just the worst I've ever experienced. I've gone on many flights and faced many delays but have always received assistance and been booked on another flight/hotel etc at the airline's expense. So I was kind of shocked when I got no assistance whatsoever.

"""cabin crew were amateur at best""","Ryanair may be ""low cost"" but their tickets are not necessarily cheap (sometimes more expensive than BA for example) by the time you have paid quite large sums for the privilege of travelling with a bag etc. They are most certainly cheap when it comes to airport services and very expensive for anything purchased onboard. The check-in process at Birmingham was perfunctory but quick, security a fairly long process as usual with inadequate staff, and boarding was fine until we stood in the airbridge for 15 minutes only to find that it was not connected anyway and so then had to descend the steps on to the ramp before going up the airstairs on the aircraft - certainly not good for the elderly and/or infirm. Similarly in Murcia, check-in was ok but long queues had formed by the time staff turned up and we were made to stand in the hot sun for 20+ minutes until the crew deigned to let us on board. At Birmingham once again no airbridge. All very convenient, I am sure, for Ryanair but not so for their customers. The cabin crew were amateur at best and seem to be there mainly to extract more cash from the passengers : all their prices are ridiculous and a claim that perfume etc is ""40% less than the high street"" is at best disingenuous. On the positive side the aircraft are clean, albeit uncomfortable, and the flights operated within 30 minutes of schedule.

So now she sent me again for the same ""office"" to pay another 200 Euros. Now, however there is only one line instead of two, so it takes another 30 minutes to pay the fee.

A fee should offer a service, so its value should be reasonable compared with the service it gives.

However, the quality this time around on our Arrecife flight was lower than it was 2 years ago, the age of the plane was 3 years, however the interior cabin looked shabby. The flight was again without incident, but the standards of aircraft interior are now much lower than say the easyJet flight I took 2 weeks prior.

"""superior couldn’t care less attitude""","For some ridiculous reason, using Ryanair online check-in which is mandatory, you need to re-enter all passport info again into the same system that already stored it when tickets were purchased. I again entered all info for our family of 8 and the website timed me out. I tried again, saving the info as I went along but their system does not allow saves. Again, timed out with an ‘error’ page. At check in we explained to a Ryanair agent what happened. She rudely told us this was not their problem and we had to pay extra. We were sent to pay for one bag and a check-in fee, amounting to $630Cdn, more than the price of 8 flights! We were told if we prove an ‘error’ page on the computer they would refund. We showed them the error page. They wouldn’t accept it there and forced us to pay up front then call customer service for a refund. We did, and received a stock email and refused us a refund.

"""never fly with them again""","Due to my taking over my daughters ex partners seat had to pay £170 for this Ryanair flight. This was purely for a name change. Although Ryanair say they only charge £110 (!) they charged £170. So the holiday was more expensive than by flying with a normal airline. As I have read previously, had to pay for returning seats as couldn't print boarding pass until we arrived at holiday resort.  So found this all a rip off.

You will buy a ticket within Europe and the currency adopted is the country of the departure, which is a normal proceedure.

I emailed them about 15 times before the flight to explain there was a problem with the amount they were charging, which was a totally different amount. To add a bag on the website is supposed to be 45 euros, but they charge 56 euros, I never understood that, and they never answered why. Their replies were nonsense emails not answering my questions.

I was very concerned for my baby granddaughter who was sweating profusely and we were in this situation for approximately 15 minutes. Why did that happen, could we not have been held back in the departure lounge. It was appalling and of course no offer of any water. On the flight there were members of staff, or I assume they were, who were helping uniformed staff but one was in shorts and t-shirt and the other casually dressed.

Ryanair customer review,"I am not a regular user of low cost airlines but on this occasion used Ryanair on due to the holiday destination airport (Chania, Crete). The check-in clerk however could benefit from a refresher course in customer service as he appeared extremely bored and disinterested. However my complaint starts when we did not print off our return boarding passes in advance of the holiday and although we tried to reserve our seats for the return flight, so my family could sit together we were unable to do this via their web-site. We gave up after 2 attempts and assumed we would check-in on arrival and take whatever seats available. We of course were not aware that they would be an additional charge for printing a boarding pass and was advised by the desk clerk to check-in on-line, again we tried to do this via our smart phone but again were unable to access the booking on the web-site. As we had spent a considerable amount of time and with mounting stress from my wife, I was forced to pay the additional charge. The 3 boarding passes were duly hand written in 10 minutes by the Servisair clerk and 135€ extracted. The clerk even told us we were lucky to get the last 3 seats even though we had booked and paid for them. I find these charges levied by Ryanair are totally disproportionate to the administration involved and are punitive in the extreme and are extracted under stressful circumstances. Up to this point we had enjoyed a fabulous holiday only to have it spoiled on our return. I have a number of issues with this penalty charge, firstly; it is not clear on their web-site when making the on-line seat reservations and printing the boarding passes for the outbound flight that you need to make the same arrangements for the return flight (or is it Ryanair’s intention to catch out the new customers?) and secondly, I regularly travel for both business and pleasure with a number of different airlines and have never come across such a policy for boarding passes. I regularly use on-line booking and the barcode via smart phone but generally this is within 24 hours prior to departure and I have never been charged for a boarding pass, this is not the industry norm.

Still perplexed with the rationale of no magazine unless you ask for one (and its not common knowledge); as soon as the beverage service commences, its a guess as to what's on offer.

Ryanair customer review,"First time flying with Ryanair since 2005 and very happy with the value for money aspect. Ryanair is like a bus. You pay a small fare and they get you where you want to go.

Didn't love having the safety card stuck at eye-level on the seat in front but again, this is a budget airline. Had a very quick taxi and takeoff from Stagnated which was great and the landing at Krakow was smooth. Great pilots. Love the comical fanfare as you touchdown.

Seeing other passengers approach a separate window that appeared to be there to sell tickets or collect overcharges, I approached, showed my passport and boarding pass and asked if I needed to remain in the check in queue. That is when she told me that because the flight was full, I would be allowed to check in my one rolling bag free of charge. After security, boarding of the flight was impressive in terms of smoothness and professionalism. There were two lines: priority for those who prepaid their seat and general for those who chose not to spend a few extra euros for excellent service and benefits. The priority line has seats for passengers but the general boarding did not. I was the first to board. I quickly found my aisle exit row seat and sat. The flight attendant walked by and asked that I store the hand bag I had with me in the overhead as it was an exit row. Priority boarding was relaxed and more civilized.

Ryanair customer review,"Second round trip with Ryanair this year and all went fairly smoothly. Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet. None of the past quibbling over cabin baggage and even on the full outward flight everyone seemed to get their bags stowed in the lockers with crew members' assistance.

There was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing, which is often the final point made during the cockpit pre-flight passenger announcement. The announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. I appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to London as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. The pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear (even in row 2). Even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair.

Ryanair customer review,"Our recent experience with Ryanair was unsatisfactory thus we cannot recommend this airline to anyone. We chose Ryanair for its low fares. The numerous fees exceeded the original cost of our tickets. While some fees are warranted, Ryanair is the only airline I have flown that charges fees to print out boarding passes. Their excess baggage weight fees are higher as well. Even more troubling is the disorganized check in and bag drop-off process and unacceptable customer service. We had to stand in one long line to drop off checked bags, another line to pay extra fees and return to the 1st line to complete the bag drop process. During this ordeal, we were met with staff who were insolent (berating us in French) and clearly had no allegiance to Ryanair (giving confusing directions).

This made the flights no cheaper than the ones that other airlines offered. The cabin - despite pictures on the internet - looked gloomy, old fashioned and dirty.

Ryanair customer review,"Dropped my bag off at the dedicated Ryanair Terminal E at Bremen. Boarding was slightly chaotic due to simultaneous departing flights to the UK, but this was not Ryanair's issue, being within the control of the airport authorities. The cabin crew were very welcoming, especially the cabin supervisor. She appeared efficient and along with the rest of the crew seemed to go out of her way to chat to as many passengers as possible when the opportunity arose.

Ryanair customer review,"The good. £200 for 2 return flights in June represents excellent value for money. Both flights were more or less on time, and the outward boarding was quite smooth. The bad. On the outward flight awful overpriced food was offered and there were 2 ‘scratch card runs ‘. On a two and a half hour flight? There being no on board magazine or duty free menu is it any wonder nobody buys any duty free goods – nobody has any idea what is for sale. At the end of the flight there was no thanks or goodbye as we left the plane the first time in 35 years I have ever had this. The two cabin crew by the rear doors totally ignored the departing passengers whilst chatting in their own language. Very unprofessional cabin crew that day. On the journey back the cabin crew were much better. There was only one scratchcard run and one hard sell on the breakfast lasagne that ‘melted in your mouth ‘. No thanks. Our real issue as we were waiting in the queue (towards the back) to embark a ground staff came up the line and attached yellow stickers to our hand luggage and boarding pass. She spoke no English, and we eventually worked out our hand luggage (which was all we had by choice) was now going in the hold. This was a bit of a disaster for us as we were now being forced to wait at the baggage reclaim at the other end , a wait which proved to be about half an hour meaning we overshot out car parking time and had to pay excess. Despite this sticker business some people behind us in the queue were removing the stickers prior to embarking and just taking the luggage on the plane anyway. But we played the game and tried to safeguard some delicate stuff we had. Despite this on arrival home we found that some articles were damaged, something that should never have happened in the first place. So, in a nutshell if you are prepared to forsake everything for a cheap flight Ryanair are the best in the business. If the travelling is a big part of your trip, avoid them like the plague. We will be in future and have decided never again.

Ryanair customer review,"2nd June Flight from Bergamo to East Midlands. Whilst in the queue to board a member of staff tagged my hand luggage and boarding pass with yellow  stickers. I was just over half way down the queue. All the people around me were being tagged so thought nothing of it. On boarding I moved to my seat half way along the plane. A member of
the crew who was stood near to my seat told me my bag should've been left at the entrance and put in the hold. I had at no point before this been told to do so. The aisle was rammed with passengers but she still wanted me to take my bag off the plane. After much discussion I persuaded her to let me put my bag in the overhead where there was plenty of space and I would remove it if necessary. I sat and watched many more passengers board who had arrived much later than me (no stickers on their bags) as it happened there was plenty of space in the lockers so my bag stayed put.

Ryanair customer review,"FR2005, Stansted to Otopeni, Romania. This was our first flight with Ryanair and we approached it with a degree of caution and apprehension. I have to say, that these feelings were unfounded. Ryanair in 2015, simply do not deserve the reputation they have. The entire booking process was easy to understand and administer. Follow the rules and it works well and easy. The flight itself was bang on time, smooth and a joy. A few of our fellow passengers were an issue, with what we understood to be their pre-emptively abrupt attitude with staff which was mildly unpleasant and entirely unnecessary but perhaps a hangover of Ryanair of old.

I was not able to do this where we were staying. They then wanted 45 euros from each off us to do this. I managed to get to a PC at the airport and do it myself.

When we eventually go to the front the check in clerk next to our queue (without any notice) closed his queue and then his queue tried to push into ours. It was appalling and could have escalated into something nasty all due to the bad customer service from Ryanair.

Ryanair customer review,I opted for Ryanair due to needing a direct flight from Gdansk to London. I read all the small print and rules to be able to pay the correct price for bag fast boarding and emergency row seat. These extras added up to about 100% to the initial price tag but even then it was quite cheap (some 70USD one-way all inclusive). There was no trouble with booking as well as with online check in. I was even able to download mobile boarding pass through the app. At the airport I only spent abut 10 minutes for bag check and visa verification. At the gate my experience was not overly pleasant with some 200 people with screaming children left on the stairs leading to the apron for about 20 minutes. Then door opened and crowd went to the plane. Since I booked priority boarding I had no trouble reaching my seat and accommodating my bag. The crew were polite and helpful. Since their hand baggage limit is strict there was no problem finding space for bags. We took off on time. The inflight experience was up to expectations but not as annoying as some wrote here. No seat recline but plenty of legroom in emergency row. The plane was very tatty but clean. Toilet was ok. We landed 10 mins ahead of schedule. Then usual labyrinth of Stansted terminal and unbelievable immigration lines for EU citizens. Due to being Ukraine national I was directed to the non-EU line which consisted of some 15-20 people so it took me 10 minutes to pass border control. My bag was already on the belt I was off the airport 20 minutes after landing. Absolutely bearable experience; you'll have no trouble if you carefully read their instruction and spend extra 10 minutes on booking process.

Ryanair customer review,"Flight FR9810 from London Stansted to Barcelona El Prat T2 on Monday 4th May 2015 scheduled to leave at 08.15 However due to Barcelona being fog bound they had delayed all flights into Barcelona apparently from many UK airports. We were firstly informed that a delay of 1.5 hours was estimated. After a while we were informed that another 1 hour had been added. So all passengers sat on the plane for 2.5 hours. Our first complaint - Sitting in a stationary hot metal tube for 2.5 hours is not my idea of enjoyment particularly when nobody was offered even the smallest drink of complimentary cold water in order to alleviate the discomfort. During the 2.5 hour delay there would have been time to have some water delivered. The irony in all of this is that shortly after take-off the cabin crew came round selling drinks. Our second complaint - Flight FR9015 Thursday 7th May - El Prat to Stansted. Taking advantage of the 10kg on board baggage allowance + small bag we purchased a second ""carry on"" cabin bag (size within stipulated regulation). On the outward journey not a problem. A different story on the return flight though. On entry to the plane I was told by a Stewardess ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I explained that we had no problems on the outward journey the cabin crew were quite happy. Not being convinced she repeated the statement ""That is not a cabin bag!"" I again repeated my statement and then went to take my seat and stow my cabin bag. Little knowing that my wife was behind me she said again in a rather snide voice ""That is not a cabin bag!"" Not wanting to cause an argument my wife just reiterated the fact that it was acceptable on the outward journey. So in summation we have a rather dim view of Ryanair.

Ryanair customer review,"I travel frequently with Ryanair mostly because its destinations and schedules are convenient. The airport teams are efficient to the point of being distant/abrupt while the flight teams are busying and friendly. Altogether I find Ryanair best of the low-budgets. However its constant and repetitious announcements inflight could really improve. On Stansted-Karlsruhe there were 11 announcements before take-off and 11 during the one-hour flight (22 announcements within 75 mins!). The content covered safety refreshments and fund-raising. On 5 of these occasions when the announcement was the first time announced it began ""Once again...."" on 7 occasions the completely unnecessary request was to ""sit back relax and enjoy the flight"".

Ryanair customer review,First time with Ryanair flying Stansted to Prague. Good price more competitively priced now than Easyjet hence deciding to travel with them instead. Flight left a little late but made up for the delay in the air and landed on time. Cabin basic and not particularly clean- we literally passed the departing passengers from our plane across the tarmac so obviously no time there to clean the plane - however if speedy turnaround keeps costs down I can put up with a few crumbs. Did not pay for allocated seating but got two decent seats one by the window. If they reduced allocated seating costs I might have considered it. Return flight also bang on time leaving and arrived early. Pilots friendly and informative although very difficult to hear as engines seemed much noisier than other airlines. Staff were definitely not as friendly as other airlines rolling eyes at passengers etc which is a shame as being cheap shouldn't mean poorer customer service. I am meticulous about measuring hand luggage as I do not want to be charged extra but the shapes and sizes of bags being allowed on was hilarious- some people looked like they'd packed for a 3 week cruise. Everything was allowed on and massive bags which would never have fitted in the cabin were allowed in the hold free of charge. Overhead lockers were completely crammed with massive hand luggage items. All in all does what it says on the tin - got us there and back alive and well on time at a good price.,time ryanair fly stanste prague good price competitively price easyjet decide travel instead flight leave little late delay air land time cabin basic particularly clean literally pass depart passenger plane tarmac obviously time clean plane speedy turnaround keep cost crumb pay allocate seating get decent seat window reduce allocate seat cost consider return flight bang time leave arrive early pilot friendly informative difficult hear engine noisy airline staff definitely friendly airline roll eye passenger etc shame cheap not mean poor customer service meticulous measure hand luggage want charge extra shape size bag allow hilarious people look like d pack week cruise allow massive bag fit cabin allow hold free charge overhead locker completely cram massive hand luggage item say tin get alive time good price,0.0018130950629711151,0.17206834256649017,0.07190927118062973,0.028559351339936256,0.001544540748000145,0.4917791783809662,0.23232623934745789,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,I booked a fairly priced return ticket between Dublin and Edinburgh in May 2015. The experience was horrible. I think the check-in and baggage drop works okay as long as you only have hand luggage and a European or UK passport. If you need to check in a bag or you require a visa it's absolute chaos. There is no clear signage the staff keeps directing you to a different queue that already has at least 50 people waiting. This was the closest I've ever come to missing a flight. The price of my ticket increased threefold with the bag I checked in (less than 20kg btw) and they even charge 15 euro to print your boarding pass. This borders on criminal if you ask me. I will never ever fly with Ryanair again and I will go out of my way to let people know how bad the service is.,book fairly price return ticket dublin edinburgh experience horrible think checkin baggage drop work okay long hand luggage european uk passport need check bag require visa absolute chaos clear signage staff keep direct different queue people wait close ve come miss flight price ticket increase threefold bag check kg btw charge euro print boarding pass border criminal ask fly ryanair way let people know bad service,0.021068185567855835,0.16590596735477448,0.22150872647762299,0.004975342191755772,0.0031249893363565207,0.518743634223938,0.06467316299676895,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,FR4774 May 14th and FR4775 May 18th. I have never been a fan of this airline but I have to admit they are moving forward and slowly getting closer to what I consider to be an enjoyable carrier to fly with (for short haul flights). Flew BGY to SKG last week for a short Greek holiday with no issue at all: on time departures/arrivals good rate for the ticket and above all some improvements I did notice compared to the last time I flew with them about 3 years ago. The main one is of course the seat allocation for everyone which prevent people from rushing to the aircraft as if it was a bus school trip. I also found seat comfort and legroom to have improved and even the cabin crew seems a bit more professional and friendly now even if they still talk too much in my opinion during the flight to try and sell whatever the can to the passengers. Another positive news is that there is no longer (at least according to my experience) an obsessive check of your hand baggage dimensions and weight at the gate which I do appreciate. Generally speaking if you check the rules carefully and comply with them you can get a great value for money as well as good and frequent direct connections. The day they stop boarding the plane half an hour before the plane is actually ready to welcome passengers onboard (thus causing people to wait on the stairs/bus/apron for up to 15 minutes) they will probably see me much more often on their planes.,fr th fr th fan airline admit move forward slowly get close consider enjoyable carrier fly short haul flight fly bgy skg week short greek holiday issue time departuresarrival good rate ticket improvement notice compare time fly year ago main course seat allocation prevent people rush aircraft bus school trip find seat comfort legroom improve cabin crew bit professional friendly talk opinion flight try sell passenger positive news long accord experience obsessive check hand baggage dimension weight gate appreciate generally speak check rule carefully comply great value money good frequent direct connection day stop board plane half hour plane actually ready welcome passenger onboard cause people wait stairsbusapron minute probably plane,0.02308117412030697,0.10683036595582962,0.07683153450489044,0.0028687254525721073,0.001801474834792316,0.594717800617218,0.193868950009346,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,MAN-PMI-MAN. Usually fly with easyJet from Liverpool but Ryanair schedules appeared first and I found cheap flights for our preferred days. Had a later bonus in that our original outward flight in the evening was cancelled and we were transferred to the morning flight which had been dearer at the time of booking. I read all the rules carefully and intended to pay for seats so that we could print off our return boarding passes before we left home. I was subsequently shocked to find that even standard seats would cost £10.99 per person per flight and this was not even high season. In the end I got up extra early on the morning of our outward journey and printed off the return passes at 02.15! It was noticeable that hardly any standard seats had been booked in advance: perhaps if the charge was less Ryanair would actually find more people choosing to pay. The flights themselves went off largely without incident. We were late departing from Manchester but then we did not start to board the plane until 15 minutes before official departure time yet this was early in the morning. I found it difficult to hear any of the announcements partly because of the noise of the engines and passengers talking loudly to compensate but also because of the gabbled way in which they were delivered. The return crew were much better in this respect despite the senior steward looking to be all of 14 years of age. Not much attention seemed to be paid to luggage sizing and it looked as if everyone got their hand luggage on board despite a completely full outward flight. Both crews worked hard throughout the flights but we were starting to descend towards Mallorca before the drinks round reached us on the outward leg. Overall though one cannot complain when we paid under £120 for two of us to fly to Mallorca for a week. When we first went there over 20 years ago we were lucky to find return flights for £200 per person in low season.,manpmiman usually fly easyjet liverpool ryanair schedule appear find cheap flight preferred day later bonus original outward flight evening cancel transfer morning flight dear time booking read rule carefully intend pay seat print return boarding pass leave home subsequently shocked find standard seat cost person flight high season end get extra early morning outward journey print return pass noticeable hardly standard seat book advance charge ryanair actually find people choose pay flight go largely incident late depart manchester start board plane minute official departure time early morning find difficult hear announcement partly noise engine passenger talk loudly compensate gabbled way deliver return crew well respect despite senior steward look year age attention pay luggage sizing look get hand luggage board despite completely outward flight crew work hard flight start descend mallorca drink round reach outward leg overall complain pay fly mallorca week go year ago lucky find return flight person low season,0.04726511612534523,0.06773208826780319,0.2114562839269638,0.031602755188941956,0.008683234453201294,0.49148258566856384,0.1417779177427292,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,I have been a passenger with numerous airlines since 1957 and in recent years frequently from Alicante to several different British airports. Ryanair is one of the worst I've ever travelled with and definitely the worst on this route. On the outward Alicante/East Midlands Airport journey we sat on the runway for almost an hour because they had missed their slot. This made for a long and tedious journey. This however was nowhere near as bad as the return flight. We left plenty of time to return the hire car and arrive at the airport in time to have a leisurely lunch (as we always do at Gatwick) as we knew that it would be late when we arrived home only to discover that we could not enter the departure lounge until 2 hours before our flight was due to leave. This would have been okay if there had been somewhere for two elderly passengers to sit (all chairs were taken and we were left standing with all our luggage) or somewhere to have a decent meal (there is one very unappetising place with food served in cardboard). Also two hours would have been sufficient time if it hadn't taken more than an hour to wind our way through the queue to the check in desk. When we arrived at the desk we were told that our case was too heavy (1kg overweight) most airlines will waive this fractional overweight but the representative told us that we had only paid for 15kg and would have to put the excess in our hand baggage. This we did in full view of the other passengers and consisted of 2 tee-shirts and a pair of light shoes. Whilst we were waiting to board the aircraft the attendant asked us if we would like to put our hand baggage in the hold free of charge! My logic and fairly basic grasp of maths cannot make sense of this! I had been warned not to travel Ryanair and I never will again.,passenger numerous airline recent year frequently alicante different british airport ryanair bad ve travel definitely bad route outward alicanteeast midland airport journey sit runway hour miss slot long tedious journey near bad return flight leave plenty time return hire car arrive airport time leisurely lunch gatwick know late arrive home discover enter departure lounge hour flight leave okay elderly passenger sit chair take leave stand luggage decent meal unappetise place food serve cardboard hour sufficient time not take hour wind way queue check desk arrive desk tell case heavy kg overweight airline waive fractional overweight representative tell pay kg excess hand baggage view passenger consist teeshirt pair light shoe whilst wait board aircraft attendant ask like hand baggage hold free charge logic fairly basic grasp math sense warn travel ryanair,0.0020028885919600725,0.15324275195598602,0.11069104820489883,0.033753927797079086,0.0017059691017493606,0.5410971641540527,0.15750627219676971,Topic_6

My husband had to push the chair when we finally got it. At the gate Ryanair staff discussed who would not be able to take the flight as there were too many disabled. They talked about us as if we were bags of carrots. Eventually I said I would try to climb the steps of the aircraft and was allowed onto the plane. At no time was I given any assistance.

Ryanair customer review,A return trip from Dublin to Malaga for a friends wedding the flight over left slightly late due chaotic boarding by the pax who seemed rather clueless as to what to do once you board a plane so you can't blame Ryanair for that. As per my last flights on FR they ran out of food and drink items and had a very limited selection and the service by a crew with a combined age of about 17 were slow and one rather got the impression that the four of them had just qualified the previous afternoon. They seemed stressed by the whole process and were again slow from the aft galley which is a surprise considering the lack of items they could possibly sell. There was a minor medical emergency where a pax fainted but they were quick and very attentive to deal with the situation. The flight back was again bereft of items from to purchase which was odd given that the plane was sitting on the ground the whole time I was at the gate before boarding (over an hour) but then even when you want to purchase something it's a bit of a guessing game due to the fact there are no menus. Anyway the flight began boarding early so early there were neither flight nor cabin crew on board. The flight itself was an awful experience due to being surrounded by children who took to screaming the majority of the time while their parents looked like they wanted to chuck themselves out the window. If I thought that the front of the cabin were an adults only area I would have paid anything to sit there maybe something to think about?

Ryanair customer review,Flew recently Dublin to Birmingham return for £20 return - unbelievable fare. Flights were very busy. There was the traditional queue for a Ryanair flight even though you have an assigned seat. I prefer to wait until the queue is actually moving and join the queue then instead of standing for no reason. No complaints about the flight - I think some of the food/drinks are overpriced but in general there is a good selection. I have noticed on recent Ryanair flights that the level of customer service have improved. There seems to be more Irish and British crew on the Irish and British flights too. I noticed the crew were especially friendly with the children on board with 2 young kids being shown into the cockpit as they saw the pilot on exiting the plane and the male cabin crew member on the tramac waving at other children as they came down the aircraft steps. Flight was good going back as well arriving in Dublin area. Great service for just £20 return.,fly recently dublin birmingham return return unbelievable fare flight busy traditional queue ryanair flight assign seat prefer wait queue actually move join queue instead stand reason complaint flight think fooddrink overprice general good selection notice recent ryanair flight level customer service improve irish british crew irish british flight notice crew especially friendly child board young kid show cockpit see pilot exit plane male cabin crew member tramac wave child come aircraft step flight good go arrive dublin area great service return,0.0029583368450403214,0.13966989517211914,0.0863969549536705,0.004010401200503111,0.0025205041747540236,0.5200467705726624,0.2443971335887909,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,FR 507 30th April. FR 506 7th May. It may be said that one gets what one pays for but by the time Ryanair has ripped through you with thier suite of extra charges many of which are simply an unfair cash grab on their unsuspecting customers at the booking counter when there is no chance of taking another airline Ryanair is not well priced. On a flight from Dublin to Bristol we were encouraged to use Ryanairs smartphone App or print out out a boarding pass to avoid an extra charge to have it printed at the booking counter. Unfortunately the App didn't work so on arriving at Dublin we were directed to the misnamed 'Customer Service' counter to be 'helped' by the most unhelpful unpleasant rude eye rolling young woman I have ever had the misfortune to encounter in many years of air travel with many airlines all over the world. When I explained the problem she tried to tell me that if the App didn't work I had plenty of time in Ireland to hunt down an Internet cafe or similar with access to a printer to print out my boarding pass and that she should now charge me for printing them out at the airport. I was then charged for an extra 3kg of baggage even though the two of us had no carry on baggage. The plane was dirty tired and run down and the cabin staff non professional. The seats are small and cramped. In summary terrible service from rude staff will strip you of cash any chance they get tired dirty aircraft poor inflight service.

Ryanair customer review,"I've been flying world-wide for more than 50 years with many different airlines. Despite many online complaints about Ryanair my experience with this airlines had been very good until my flight from Malaga to Venice (Treviso) on May 6 (FR 2597) when an incompetent female flight attendant and a very rude belligerent male maitre d'cabin (both Malaga-based) changed my perception of the airline. The maitre d' shouted and yelled and my son who expressed his concern regarding fresh air and cooler air temperature in the cabin. Ryanair is a budget airline and I'm aware of that but budget does not mean poor maintenance and rude and unfriendly flight crew. As a very frequent airline passenger I must point out that there are more and more budget airlines in the world and competition for the passengers is tougher every single day.

Ryanair customer review,I flew from Stansted to Tours. I was very careful to read and understand the rules. Two of us traveled so I booked 2 seats which also gave us priority boarding and enabled us to print off boarding passes well in advance. The flight was excellent as was the coffee.

Ryanair customer review,Unusually this was my first trip with FR for 4 months. CCF to STN return. Surprised to be allocated the same back row seat for both flights even though I'd not paid for seat choice. I thought these rear (and front) seats cost extra? Anyway not complaining as it meant speedy disembarkation at both destinations. Good to see that the Ryanair charm offensive has not run out of steam and they really do seem to be making serious efforts to up their public image. Return leg absolutely full but boarding was efficient enough and we arrived 20 mins early. Both flights were on two of FR's more elderly planes (those in the EI-DC* range) and frankly they are starting to show a lot of wear and tear which is hardly surprising when you consider how hard they work. Have the food and drink prices gone up recently? £4.50 for a coffee and a biscuit seems a bit OTT to me but I guess you don't have to buy. In summary a couple of years ago I'd have advised anyone to avoid Ryanair at all costs if there was even a vaguely convenient alternative. Happily nowadays I'm quite keen to recommend them to anyone on any route if getting from A to B in the shortest time for the least money including bags etc is a priority.,unusually trip fr month ccf stn return surprised allocate row seat flight d pay seat choice think rear seat cost extra complain mean speedy disembarkation destination good ryanair charm offensive run steam make effort public image return leg absolutely boarding efficient arrive min early flight frs elderly plane eidc range frankly start lot wear tear hardly surprising consider hard work food drink price go recently coffee biscuit bit ott guess not buy summary couple year ago d advise avoid ryanair cost vaguely convenient alternative happily nowadays m keen recommend route get b short time money include bag etc priority,0.013786500319838524,0.07275300472974777,0.09608739614486694,0.003250164445489645,0.002040517283603549,0.6122923493385315,0.19979003071784973,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,"FR 3002 17th April. FR 3015 20th April. I have travelled with Ryanair for years now and in recent times the customer service and service in general has become increasingly poor. I travelled recently to Rome and this was a very poor experience - the flights were late the customer service was very poor and the cabins filthy. The yellow tagging farce is actually funny to watch - the policy as I was rudely told is the ""first 90 bags"" however it was totally random with customers with large trolley bags walking through and then other customers behind them being tagged?! There is no correct monitoring system for this whatsoever so you are at the mercy of the poorly trained staff on the gate. You then get onto the flight to find several spaces in the overhead lockers and several empty seats! Quite frankly I am fed up with the continual poor service so I have now booked with Aer Lingus for my next trip to Dublin.

Having arrived late on the Friday night I was up again early next day to work and meetings in the city and was lucky enough to catch the Bath v Leinster cup game in the afternoon. However that left little time to make it to the airport for the return flight which I did. On arrival I was chastised for not having printed off a boarding pass. How I was expected to do that heavens only knows but that fell on deaf ears and I had to pay up 70 euros extra to get on board.

Ryanair customer review,Used Ryanair on a way flight from Murcia to Stansted on the 30th of April which was fine. It was on time and I only had carry on luggage only and had printed off a boarding pass beforehand and as always if you play their game it all works well. The flight was only £40 and considering I had driven the first leg at a cost of £200 I have no idea how they manage to provide flights so cheaply. The cabin crew did their best but there was no milk for drinks or inflight magazines which was a bit of a disaster and raised a laugh with the passengers (well some of them with a sense of humour) and of course out came the dreaded scratch cards at the end of the flight but the plane was clean on time and I was happy with my trip and will use them again.,ryanair way flight murcia stanste th april fine time carry luggage print boarding pass play game work flight consider drive leg cost idea manage provide flight cheaply cabin crew good milk drink inflight magazine bit disaster raise laugh passenger sense humour course come dreaded scratch card end flight plane clean time happy trip use,0.05996665731072426,0.057188767939805984,0.12117896974086761,0.005504141561686993,0.040698450058698654,0.4756459593772888,0.2398170679807663,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Flying from Faro to Glasgow Prestwick. I have flown with Ryanair before on short flights from Glasgow to Dublin which were fine (although had us standing outside in the freezing cold waiting to board for 20 minutes). Faro to Glasgow was a 3 hour flight and I am 6 months pregnant. I had to drag my suitcase up the stairs to board the plane and stand waiting there for a good 10 minutes until other passengers had taken their seats. When we arrived at our seats there was no room in the overhead stow for our luggage as other passengers had obviously ran out of space in their own areas and decided just to cram 4 cases into ours leaving us with nothing. My husband had to try and make room for our bags in stows away from where we were sitting. During this the cabin crew just gormlessly stood by and offered no assistance. Menus were handed out but only to passengers in the front seats as they didn't have enough to go round. It was a lunchtime flight and I was hungry and asked the stewardess while she was passing with the trolley if I could buy a panini. I was told they had ran out (again as there was only enough for the passengers in the front seats). No alternative was offered. The staff looked tired and fed up. Also there was a hen do on board with one idiot randomly shouting at the top of her voice. I didn't see any cabin crew addressing this. I would only fly Ryanair for very short flights if desperate. Will avoid in future and would certainly not recommend when over 3 months pregnant!

Ryanair customer review,I was due to fly back from Ireland with my husband and two kids when my daughter contracted chickenpox. I contacted the airline four days before the flight and explained that my husband and daughter would not be travelling with us but that my mother had purchased another ticket and would be sitting in my husband's seat (I didn't think this was necessary as we had paid the additional fee to sit in the seats that we chose but wanted to make sure my mother's journey was stress free). It was confirmed that this would be fine. When we got to the airport we made sure it was still ok as my mother has limited mobility and finds air travel extremely difficult. They confirmed again that they had kept the seat we had paid for. When we got to the gate my mother had paid for priority boarding but a stuff up by the staff there meant we were left waiting to get onto the plane until after they had removed one of the sets of stairs. When we finally got onto the plane we found a lady sitting in our seat with a ticket for the very seat we had paid for.

Ryanair customer review,Ryanair baggage policy and terms are very clear but on recent flights there was evidence that it is enforced. On the flight out to Seville it took 30 minutes for the cabin crew to make space in the overhead lockers because of the number of oversized bags. On the return flight to Stansted our luggage which complied with the policy along with the baggage of a third of the passengers was put in the hold while many oversized bags were put in the overhead lockers.

Ryanair customer review,"Over the past month I have been on four FR flights. The first two were short hops to the UK and back the first of which (to Manchester) the trolley service didn't even make it to me due to the short duration of the flight which I didn't really mind. The flight back from Bristol was a mess and possibly the hottest plane I've been on in quite a while. Overall the service wasn't too bad they left on time and popping cabin baggage into the hold at the last minute is a great idea really speeds up the boarding process once you're on board. Just back from Barcelona the flight over was as good as any but they ran out of certain items so one wonders what pax on the way back did for food and certain drinks and frankly the seat stays comfortable for just about the duration of the flight. Turns out I didn't have to wonder what the pax on the way back did there was barely even a bottle of water left on the plane I flew home on. The inflight service from the the back was incredibly slow which probably had something to do with the fact that the crew in this section clearly did not get along. This was maybe due to the lazy attitude of one of them who declared quite audibly that she wasn't walking back to the galley to fetch something as she ""couldn't be bothered"". I've been on a couple of FR flights in the past while where the cabin crew did not get along nor try to hide it at all which is something they could look at somehow. On the whole though I don't mind flying FR once you know what you're at and what to expect then you shouldn't have a major issue.",past month fr flight short hop uk manchester trolley service not short duration flight not mind flight bristol mess possibly hot plane ve overall service not bad leave time pop cabin baggage hold minute great idea speed boarding process board barcelona flight good run certain item wonder pax way food certain drink frankly seat stay comfortable duration flight turn not wonder pax way barely bottle water leave plane fly home inflight service incredibly slow probably fact crew section clearly maybe lazy attitude declare audibly not walk galley fetch not bother ve couple fr flight past cabin crew try hide look not mind fly fr know expect not major issue,0.013323035091161728,0.06549962610006332,0.06232006475329399,0.014051650650799274,0.013001491315662861,0.5878936052322388,0.2439105361700058,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Enjoyed a wonderful nine day break in Spain/Portugal. This whole break was marred by the Ryanair who think its acceptable to charge 140 euros for a two minute process of online check in which I had already done - funny how all our personal/passport details were already there along with the 'premium' seats I booked at the time of online checking in of our return flight. As we were in remote places with an old blackberry phone we were prepared to pay the still unreasonable boarding pass printing charge. Ryanair are in the position where they can hold you hostage until you pay. Their trump card is the fact we all have to get home even if it means paying a ransom to get there and they are not interested in considering the 'customer' might be right.,enjoy wonderful day break spainportugal break mar ryanair think acceptable charge euro minute process online check funny personalpassport detail premium seat book time online checking return flight remote place old blackberry phone prepared pay unreasonable boarding pass printing charge ryanair position hold hostage pay trump card fact home mean pay ransom interested consider customer right,0.0039017831441015005,0.1674184501171112,0.33082064986228943,0.005297640338540077,0.003322494914755225,0.4004817008972168,0.08875729888677597,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,"Four of us flew from Stansted (London) to Dublin on Good Friday April 3 2015. The gate crew and on-board crew were all friendly cheery and helpful the plane itself was surprisingly comfortable (muchmore comfortable than the United 757s we flew to/from Dublin the week before) and on-board food and beverage choices were decent and not horribly pricey. We departed promptly on time arrived on time and getting on/off was efficiently managed by the crew. Nearly everyone else on our flight was part of a huge school trip (kids about 12-14 plus their ""keepers"") and the crew members were great with the kids - kept them as organized as possible and were flexible about changing seat assignments so that friends could sit together - very nice to see! Here are the only two reasons I didn't give Ryanair an overall ""10"" rating: 1) I received mobile-phone alerts reminding me to do online check-in and get mobile boarding passes. Sounds easy enough but after four tries I was still unable to input our information - no explanation given. Finally on the fifth try it worked: I added all of the requested info (passport numbers etc.) for our party and then got a message saying ""We are unable to issue mobile boarding passes"" - again no explanation at all. Since I didn't have access to a computer or printer I began to panic especially after reading that there was a fee of 70 pounds per person to check in at the airport! Thank heavens our B&B owner came to the rescue and offered me the use of his personal computer and printer to complete the online check-in and print boarding passes. 2) We arrived at Stansted with more than two hours to spare before our flight got through security in record time and began checking the boards to see which gate we'd depart from. We sat down in the Coast to Coast restaurant to grab brunch while waiting all the while keeping an eye on the Departures board but out gate number wasn't posted until 15 minutes before departure time! Worse it turned out that our gate was a nearly 10-minute walk from the restaurant so all of on this flight had to do a mad dash for the gate at (almost) the last minute. I've never ever seen a gate number posted so late in the game especially when the gate was fairly far away - that was just baffling. Other than those two glitches however the Ryanair flight was a great deal for the money and I'd certainly fly them again.",fly stansted london dublin good friday april gate crew onboard crew friendly cheery helpful plane surprisingly comfortable muchmore comfortable united s fly tofrom dublin week onboard food beverage choice decent horribly pricey depart promptly time arrive time get onoff efficiently manage crew nearly flight huge school trip kid plus keeper crew member great kid keep organize possible flexible change seat assignment friend sit nice reason not ryanair overall rating receive mobilephone alert remind online checkin mobile boarding pass sound easy try unable input information explanation give finally fifth try work add request info passport number etc party get message say unable issue mobile boarding pass explanation not access computer printer begin panic especially read fee pound person check airport thank heavens bb owner come rescue offer use personal computer printer complete online checkin print boarding pass arrive stansted hour spare flight get security record time begin check board gate d depart sit coast coast restaurant grab brunch wait keep eye departure board gate number not post minute departure time bad turn gate nearly minute walk restaurant flight mad dash gate minute ve see gate number post late game especially gate fairly far away baffle glitch ryanair flight great deal money d certainly fly,0.014759180136024952,0.05457617715001106,0.17704443633556366,0.0018880106508731842,0.014648434706032276,0.5355513095855713,0.2015324980020523,Topic_6

However the flight time was good and the price was even better. I did pre-book seats as we were travelling with grandparents. The flight was ok. The crew were polite and helpful but despite offering an extensive 'cafe' service the only food available was a hot panini. As others have mentioned families were split as the flight was full then these people expected others to move so they could be together. I was not asked but others were annoyed. The flight was delayed and I lost count of the times the cabin crew and pilot stressed it was because of earlier problems at Manchester Airport not their fault.

Ryanair customer review,"Last week I flew Ryanair for the first time. I didn't expect much from low-cost so I wasn't disappointed in any sense. The flight was from Gdansk to Stansted. I purchased priority service and 15 kg hold bag allowance. At check in desk they spent 5 minutes checking my documents since not many non-eu travelers use this service. They even printed me a ""conventional"" boarding pass. At the gate there was an expected 15 min wait in a crowd on the stairs leading to apron. Not pleasant for parents with crying children all around but bearable for solo traveler. A short walk to the plane then got to my seat. Since it was an exit seat can't say anything about standard legroom. What I had was fine. No seat recline. The seat was ok. Announcements were not noisy.

Ryanair customer review,I used the new business class when booking my flight mainly due to the price. Whilst the cost is reasonable to be honest it wasn't worth it. I didn't take luggage so no cost benefit to me. At Stansted I did get through security about 10 minutes quicker. Priority boarding going out was standing on the Tarmac for longer. The return from Morocco didn't give me any benefits as whilst the priority boards were first onto the bus to get to the plane everyone else was on the bus so we had to stand in a long queue. I do feel you should provide a hot drink and a snack at least as part of the package. Regardless of this the staff as always are helpful and kind. This experience won't put me off using Ryanair but may just stick to economy as the business cost is too much for too little.,new business class book flight mainly price whilst cost reasonable honest not worth not luggage cost benefit stanste security minute quick priority boarding go stand tarmac long return morocco not benefit whilst priority board bus plane bus stand long queue feel provide hot drink snack package regardless staff helpful kind experience will not ryanair stick economy business cost little,0.003713967278599739,0.02672015316784382,0.1836666464805603,0.022072680294513702,0.0031643181573599577,0.6640338897705078,0.0966283455491066,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,As a non-EU passenger who lives in London UK I have to fill out a landing card whenever I am coming home. With any other airline landing cards are offered to persons like myself during the flight. This saves time filling it out later at customs. However they are never offered on Ryanair. On a recent flight home from Gdansk I decided to ask the crew for a card since I figured that they would not voluntarily offer one. The crew member stated that they would bring one and did bring me some sort of card which was half in Arabic half in French which appeared to be for passengers arriving in Morocco. It was completely different to the standard form. Later in the flight I spoke to another member of the crew about it pointing out that it was the wrong type of card. She giggled and mumbled something about hanging onto it 'just in case.' I pointed out that she was not making any sense. How hard would it be to carry some landing cards on the flight? If this is for some reason not possible then perhaps the staff need better training in terms of what to do if a passenger request one. Perhaps they could simply tell the passenger 'sorry we do not carry those on-board.' The whole episode was just silly.,noneu passenger live london uk fill landing card come home airline landing card offer person like flight save time fill later customs offer ryanair recent flight home gdansk decide ask crew card figure voluntarily offer crew member state bring bring sort card half arabic half french appear passenger arrive morocco completely different standard form later flight speak member crew point wrong type card giggle mumble hang case point make sense hard carry landing card flight reason possible staff need well training term passenger request simply tell passenger sorry carry onboard episode silly,0.04260306805372238,0.09174951165914536,0.23943792283535004,0.04045204445719719,0.04818842560052872,0.42208272218704224,0.11548630893230438,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Flew from Aarhus (Denmark) to London Stansted on Sunday 15th February. Flight punctual but flight crew unfriendly and had an issue with a child occupying one of the emergency exit seats but who's fault is that when all seats are allocated prior to boarding?

Ryanair customer review,After many years I finally got my husband to travel on Ryanair. Due to flight times he finally agreed. On the way back from Alicante Sunday 22 February we were pleasantly surprised to get through booking in speedily and then board all in good time. There was an announcement was that the plane was fully booked. We couldn't understand this as we were surrounded by empty seats. Then it was announced that they were waiting for some passengers who had been delayed. The next announcement was that the passengers were 70 Spanish schoolchildren. Eventually after 45 minutes after departure time the plane finally left. The landing and take-off resembled a roller coaster ride with much screaming and shouting. I'm not sure who I felt most sorry for the cabin crew or the passengers.

Ryanair customer review,Ryanair is the only airline that flies from Bournemouth direct to Malta so great so far as very local. However the purchasing of tickets is laborious and time consuming. The cost of the flights easily double should you reserve a seat (standard elsewhere) or want to stow luggage in the hold (standard elsewhere). The cabin crew were unbelievably poor and one even had a broken shoe ripped trousers un-ironed shirt and jacket and tie that was thrown on.

Ryanair customer review,I had a return flight London Stansted to Athens during February half term with Ryanair. I paid exactly as I expected as I did what Ryanair asks - checked in online and print boarding passes at home. The flight out was very busy and we were told at the gate that our cabin baggage would not be allowed in the cabin. However taking a small bag on board was not an issue so we could take books etc onto the aeroplane. The flight left STN around 20 minutes late which happens so arrived slightly late. However the return flight landed early. The cabin has enough space for me at 6 foot tall and despite being a four hour flight it was fine.

On all other flights being a small hop flight you can turn up an hour before the flight do a self-service confirmation get your ticket and get on a flight. I arrived an hour early and was told I had missed my flight! I asked the helpful airport staff and they directed me to the Ryanair desks. 50 minutes to go - no staff on any of the 5 desks. When I enquired further the airport staff told me that since I had not checked in on-line they had closed the flight. They would not be manning the desks again until 10 minutes after my flight left. They told me that even if I could have booked in on the self-service (Ryanair only) terminals I would have been charged an extra £60 for checking myself in. My advice?

On arrival at Gatwick the stairs were moved to the door ready for us to disembark but there seemed to be a problem and the cabin crew did not open the door. We sat there and waited and waited but not once did any member of the cabin crew explain to us why we were still sitting there. Eventually after some considerable time we used our own initiative and used the exit at the back of the plane. At no time did the Ryanair staff say anything! So much for Health and Safety. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable but as I am only 5ft 4ins not too bad for me but must be horrid if you are tall with long legs. Will try not to use again.,flight uk dublin night th january surprised pleased hear arrive min ahead time arrival gatwick stair move door ready disembark problem cabin crew open door sit wait wait member cabin crew explain sit eventually considerable time initiative exit plane time ryanair staff health safety seat cramp uncomfortable ft in bad horrid tall long leg try use,0.004080706275999546,0.022572822868824005,0.07925949990749359,0.005534906405955553,0.02366221509873867,0.7344397902488708,0.1304500252008438,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,PRG-STN. Get what you pay for. Was mildly annoyed when I checked my reservation and saw that my only options as a non EU was to print my own boarding pass why no mobile option like everybody else? Check in desk was opened an hour before boarding and manned by one person. On the other side (for premium members?) there were 2 more employees but they were too busy giggling and messing around to consider taking a few passengers off the hands of the sole employee for economy. he was very friendly/quick and didn't seem at all jaded or phased that it was him vs 200 plus people. As I was in the front of the line my wait was short. The flight was full and everybody seemed to have carry on that well exceeded the limit so I was glad I paid the extra and checked my bag. Nobody was called out re succeeding the luggage limits so overhead space was at a premium but they got it all stowed. Cabin comfort was average and flight crew were pleasant enough. Arrived on time/luggage was offloaded quickly. All in all it was still a great price and well worth the money for the convenience of a short direct flight.,prgstn pay mildly annoy check reservation see option non eu print boarding pass mobile option like everybody check desk open hour boarding man person premium member employee busy giggle mess consider take passenger hand sole employee economy friendlyquick not jade phase vs plus people line wait short flight everybody carry exceed limit glad pay extra check bag call succeed luggage limit overhead space premium get stow cabin comfort average flight crew pleasant arrive timeluggage offload quickly great price worth money convenience short direct flight,0.07283965498209,0.22651083767414093,0.14010006189346313,0.015852680429816246,0.0022596647031605244,0.39075735211372375,0.15167972445487976,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Without doubt the worst airline that I have flown with. We had to check in at the airport and although my wife's check in went through in time mine missed by a couple of seconds and for this we were charged 70 euro's each. My wife was allocated a seat in the second row and I was allocated a seat in the very last row even though there were plenty of seats vacant together elsewhere in the plane. There was no organisation with regards to queues re both checking in and boarding the plane. When we landed we had to wait for ages to disembark as the ground staff forgot to bring the steps out for the front of the plane and then when went through customs we were asked for our landing passes which we did not have as they were not given out by staff as they were supposed to be. The seats were the most uncomfortable that I have sat on and the staff were not very friendly at all.

Ryanair customer review,Today I had the displeasure of flying with these bunch of amateurs. It is 13th January today and it was very snowy and cold at Knock. Ryanair staff as usual left us all standing in the snow outside the terminal building for ten minutes. It was bitterly cold and those of you who don't know Knock it is very open to the elements. It was freezing. We eventually boarded and we sat for 1 hour 50 minutes whilst waiting for an explanation as to why we were sitting waiting to depart. We were told that Knock airport staff were clearing the running when out of the sky arrives an inbound flight. Neither the cabin crew or the flight deck crew told us anything other than there was going to be a ten minute delay. Just not good enough especially as during the delay the cabin crew were to the front of the plane talking and joking rather than looking after their passengers.,today displeasure fly bunch amateur th january today snowy cold knock ryanair staff usual leave stand snow outside terminal building minute bitterly cold not know knock open element freeze eventually board sit hour minute whilst wait explanation sit wait depart tell knock airport staff clear running sky arrive inbound flight cabin crew flight deck crew tell go minute delay good especially delay cabin crew plane talk joke look passenger,0.028296271339058876,0.03764914348721504,0.04173769801855087,0.00488913431763649,0.0030711758881807327,0.6453285217285156,0.23902806639671326,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,After spending Christmas with my family in Uberlingen Germany my husband and I struggled back to Memmingen Airport for the Ryanair flight back to Stansted on 27th December in freezing blizzard conditions and it was no surprise to us or other people waiting for the 14.40 Stansted flight that we were advised there was at least an hour's delay in the arrival of the Ryanair flight out of Stansted. Eventually it arrived and we were called to await boarding. We were then told to cross the tarmac to the plane for boarding. However when we reached the plane we were not allowed to board. There was a barrier over both entrances to the plane. The whole plane-load of passengers were kept outside on the tarmac in windy freezing conditions for about 15 minutes. There were babes in arms tiny children and elderly people standing outside a plane we had been given permission to board in freezing conditions. People in the queues were shouting to be allowed to board to no avail. When I returned home I wrote to Ryanair: requesting an explanation as to why passengers were called to board before the plane was ready when the plane was parked just outside the Airport buildings and also asking that the explanation be passed on to all adult passengers aboard that flight. I thought that would be the very least they could do. Ryanair sent an acknowledgement of my letter saying they were looking into the matter and I have not heard from Ryanair since.,spend christmas family uberlingen germany husband struggle memmingen airport ryanair flight stanste th december freeze blizzard condition surprise people wait stansted flight advise hour delay arrival ryanair flight stansted eventually arrive call await boarding tell cross tarmac plane boarding reach plane allow board barrier entrance plane planeload passenger keep outside tarmac windy freezing condition minute babe arm tiny child elderly people stand outside plane give permission board freeze condition people queue shout allow board avail return home write ryanair request explanation passenger call board plane ready plane park outside airport building ask explanation pass adult passenger aboard flight think ryanair send acknowledgement letter say look matter hear ryanair,0.03318974748253822,0.0748947486281395,0.07995706051588058,0.015039707534015179,0.0020836787298321724,0.7412693500518799,0.053565673530101776,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Ryanair is fine to fly most of the time to get from A to B and if you can go hand luggage only. But that isn't always possible and today at Alicante the Bag Drop was pretty shambolic and stressful having to queue for more than an hour to drop off a case with people getting more and more frantic as the clock ticked by. It might have been because they had about 6 full flights scheduled one after another in a 2 hour period and only 3 desks for bag drop off. Plus they were charging everyone who was even just slightly over the weight which led to queues being at a stand still as people tried to rearrange their luggage or go and sort out the extra payments. If this is a frequent occurrence (will be watching as am a frequent flier) I will definitely avoid Ryanair as much as possible in the future. I will and have paid the premium for the extra business fare but the huge omission is that there is no priority drop off. Unlike Easyjet who give priority at bag drop if you have speedy boarding/easyjet plus. Makes the business fare bundle all a bit pointless since you have allocated seats anyway. If Ryanair introduced a priority drop-off as an optional extra I would happily pay it rather than stand in a queue for an hour.,ryanair fine fly time b hand luggage not possible today alicante bag drop pretty shambolic stressful have queue hour drop case people get frantic clock tick flight schedule hour period desk bag drop plus charge slightly weight lead queue stand people try rearrange luggage sort extra payment frequent occurrence watch frequent flier definitely avoid ryanair possible future pay premium extra business fare huge omission priority drop unlike easyjet priority bag drop speedy boardingeasyjet plus make business fare bundle bit pointless allocate seat ryanair introduce priority dropoff optional extra happily pay stand queue hour,0.054253268986940384,0.13563844561576843,0.06909580528736115,0.027290072292089462,0.028316114097833633,0.6294127106666565,0.05599360913038254,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,"Tallinn to Milan first and last time flying with Ryanair. Ryanair is by far the worst airline I have experienced in terms of customer service fees and travel experience. This was our first time flying with Ryanair and after booking our flight we were traveling often without internet service when we got to the airport to check-in 2 hours before our flight we were informed that there would be a 70Euro fee/person! We had no email from Ryanair about the need to check-in online 2 hours before departure. The online check-in cut-off time is arbitrary as it serves no purpose other than a deliberate tactic by Ryanair to extort additional funds from paying customers who at that point have no alternative but to pay and board the flight. We then were forced to wait in a crowded gate area and our flight departure was delayed by over an hour. During our time at the gate several Ryanair ""customer service"" agents made their way through the crowd demanding that some passengers must check their carry-on luggage. Almost every passenger with more than one carry-on item was ordered to leave their additional carry-on at the ground by the plane to load in to the hold. After making our way across the runway in freezing rain and snow we slowly made our way up the outdoor stairs to the plane only to be met with a surly male steward who was talking with a staff member instead of greeting passengers. All of the staff were rude and only spoke to passengers to ask to purchase items. Every item including water was provided only for a fee. We arrived in Milan only to be told that we had to sit on the plane to wait for a bus to take us to the terminal. One bus came and filled with passengers. We were in the back of the plane so we had to wait another long period for another bus. Bottom line - this was the worst travel experience in my 30 years of global travel. Yes the airline industry has changed significantly to cut costs and keep fares reasonable but there is no need to intentionally make customers feel worthless. I will gladly pay more for a flight to not be extorted for additional monies and to have a smile and a friendly hello delivered by the airline staff.",tallinn milan time fly ryanair ryanair far bad airline experience term customer service fee travel experience time fly ryanair book flight travel internet service get airport checkin hour flight inform euro feeperson email ryanair need checkin online hour departure online checkin cutoff time arbitrary serve purpose deliberate tactic ryanair extort additional fund pay customer point alternative pay board flight force wait crowded gate area flight departure delay hour time gate ryanair customer service agent way crowd demand passenger check carryon luggage passenger carryon item order leave additional carryon ground plane load hold make way runway freeze rain snow slowly way outdoor stair plane meet surly male steward talk staff member instead greet passenger staff rude speak passenger ask purchase item item include water provide fee arrive milan tell sit plane wait bus terminal bus come fill passenger plane wait long period bus line bad travel experience year global travel yes airline industry change significantly cut cost fare reasonable need intentionally customer feel worthless gladly pay flight extort additional monie smile friendly hello deliver airline staff,0.031212706118822098,0.1335650533437729,0.1422942876815796,0.022606899961829185,0.0012472729431465268,0.5931287407875061,0.07594504207372665,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,"My wife and I live in Spain and had booked a flight from Malaga to Stansted and a return flight from Stansted to Malaga some five weeks later. The night before our flight out of Malaga I duly went online to the Ryanair website to do the Online Check In. I filled in the flight details and submitted it then there was on option to print the Boarding Pass however I didn't have a printer my apartment so I assumed that since I had submitted the details all would be fine. This was not the case however. On arrival at Malaga Airport the next day we went to the Ryanair check in point that was at least 100 metres away from any other check in desk (probably so that other passengers could not hear any passenger complaints) We were asked for our Boarding Passes. I said that he had checked in online but had no way of printing the Boarding Pass. The Ryanair representative said that her computer was not showing that the Online Check In had been done. Although I insisted that I had submitted the Check In form online there was no way that I could prove it. The Ryanair Online Check In requires that the submit button is clicked on numerous times as it wants to sell extra luggage allowance hotels car hire and selected seats. If the submit button is not clicked on by-passing each of these selection options then the Online Check In does not go through. The Ryanair representative said that we would have to pay 70 Euros each for not submitting the Online Check In and for printing the Boarding Passes but as an alternative we were then told to take our laptop to the Ryanair Information Desk where they could have 15 minutes of free use of the Wi-Fi to find the details. The Wi-Fi was password protected however and the Ryanair staff member was not exactly showing any signs of wanting to help. I am of the opinion that it was extremely difficult if not impossible for a passenger to be able to retrieve the data. With time to board fast approaching we had no option but to pay 70 Euros each a Rip-Off total of 140 Euros to print two boarding passes.

Ryanair customer review,Although some people had not spoken very well of Ryanair. I have the opposite to say. In both destinations in Athens and Stansted I found the staff very polite and very helpful. They were very organised and I was pleasantly surprised. The seats on the aeroplane were not too comfortable but for a short trip it didn't matter. The plus point was that travelling with a small child the arms of the seat lifted up and being flat it was easier for my daughter to sleep on the journey. The only down point that I could say is that the staff talking on the intercom I could not understand very well their English or Greek. This could have been a fault of the intercom. I found them excellent and compared to other airlines very competitive. It was the first time I had travelled with them and would do it again. I gave fair for value for money but that's because all flights from Greece to England are far too expensive.

The last year has seen a major improvement as a result of their charm offensive. Gone are the rugby scrums to get the best seats the petty case weighing and the inflexible enforcement of rules. Most of the recent flights I've been on (these two included) have been pretty full but there's been the opportunity to move to a less crowded section in spite of the usual 'not allowed due to weight and balance of the aircraft' nonsense trotted out by the purser at the start of the flight. I was surprised on the outbound sector that they used the jet way piers at BCN thereby loading from only the front door and rendering the boarding process rather chaotic and long-winded. First time I've ever seen this on a FR flight and you can see why they prefer a front and rear door approach. As always both flights were on time and it may just be that I've become immune to them but the intrusive sales related tannoy babble during the flight does seem to have been cut back. As others have said if you stay within their rules flying Ryanair can be reasonably pleasant these days. May it long continue.,bcn stn return dread fly ryanair practice little choice year see major improvement result charm offensive go rugby scrum good seat petty case weigh inflexible enforcement rule recent flight ve include pretty s opportunity crowd section spite usual allow weight balance aircraft nonsense trot purser start flight surprised outbound sector jet way pier bcn load door render boarding process chaotic longwinde time ve see fr flight prefer rear door approach flight time ve immune intrusive sale relate tannoy babble flight cut say stay rule fly ryanair reasonably pleasant day long continue,0.015892144292593002,0.17751216888427734,0.1310795545578003,0.003616947680711746,0.053730208426713943,0.32677268981933594,0.29139626026153564,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Outbound from Birmingham - Trieste on 11th Sept returning 25/09. This continual drivel about paying for boarding cards at the airport. Why do people persist in doing it? Print the boarding card before you leave for the airport. It's that simple. Priority boarding why? All seats are allocated before you walk up the stairs. I travel with Ryanair 2 or 3 times per year.

Ryanair customer review,We were a party of 4 that flew out to Malta from Bristol on 2nd November 2014. I had pre-booked seats and needed special assistance as I had broken my leg 4 days before travelling. We had no complaints at all about Bristol everything went smoothly. However Malta was a different story on our return to Bristol on 9th November 2014. We had no bags to check in so went straight to the Departure section. Though I had pre-booked our seats and we should have had priority it was like a free for all the operative walked around the queue collecting boarding passes. I again needed special assistance and was subjected to a lecture from the Maltese operative because I had not checked in for this assistance. Nowhere on the boarding pass did it say I needed to check in just go to the departure gate. I informed the flight crew that I could not walk to the rear door (our seats were at the front) but no notice was taken of this and I had to wait until the cherry picker was brought to the front. A very officious young lady informed me I was delaying the plane as the next flight could not load. When we returned home I found an email dated the 4th November (we flew out on the 2nd November) informing me what I had to do to obtain special assistance.

Ryanair customer review,Dublin to Lanzorate to Dublin in October flights cost almost £1000 for 2 people. Boarded the plane took our seats I'm tall and ended up looking at my knees for the duration of the flight. Looking for somewhere to put my newspaper and the other normal things you bring onboard - there was no little pocket at the back of the seat in front of me with the result I had to pile everything on my knee leaving the tray table in a very awkward position.

Ryanair customer review,Paphos to Rome. FR 9697. October 31. Business Plus is a waste of money if there is a bus from the terminal to the plane since then one does not receive Priority Boarding. Also there is no Priority Deboarding so if one is in row 16/17 and there are exits front and rear then one is last off the plane and last at Passport Control. To be of value Business Plus passengers should always board first and deplane first. This would mean that the passengers would travel in a separate bus and all the Business Plus seats should be at the front of the plane just as in any other airline.,paphos rome fr october business plus waste money bus terminal plane receive priority boarding priority deboarding row exit rear plane passport control value business plus passenger board deplane mean passenger travel separate bus business plus seat plane airline,0.005492900498211384,0.029658451676368713,0.18468518555164337,0.007446316536515951,0.00467995461076498,0.6996397972106934,0.06839742511510849,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,I flew with Ryanair on Sept. 19/14 Dublin to Gatwick. As I had not checked in online I was told that I had to pay 70 Euros. I explained that I did not have access to a computer but that was no excuse - they said I would have to pay or I was not going anywhere. I had already paid 30 Euros for my piece of Luggage at time of booking so after paying and having requested wheelchair assistance on my original booking I was told to sit on a bench and wait. Eventually I was taken the departure gate only to be told after waiting 1/2 an hour and asking that the plane was 45 minutes late and would be leaving from a different gate. When we finally boarded - I did have priority boarding but that didn't seem to matter I had to walk across the tarmac to the plane and with much difficulty walk up the steps to the aircraft with my small carry on (I was not offered any assistance) to the last row. The last straw was when we were finally airborne I asked for a drink of water to take some medication and was told it would cost me 3 euros.

Ryanair customer review,"AGP - LPL. Usually fly with easyJet but Ryanair had a more convenient time for our return from Malaga. Had to pay for seats in order to print off boarding passes before leaving home so went the whole hog and paid for priority boarding as well. Didn't encounter any problems although the boarding agents did not arrive till 10 minutes before the gate was officially due to close. No checking of hand luggage dimensions nor application of ruling to allow first 90 bags only onboard as far as we could see so the last passengers to board were struggling to find locker space. Perhaps with a late night flight staff are more concerned about getting home as quickly as possible. Almost 15 minutes late taking off but made up time en route. Cabin crew were friendly and worked hard both helping passengers to stow bags and then later serving refreshments etc. Overall a relatively painless trip though not as relaxing as with easyJet. Minor gripes - the ""leather"" seats are rather unforgiving after a couple of hours and the announcements from the cabin and cockpit crew often difficult to hear as Ryanair's Boeings seem noisier than easyJet's Airbuses and crew tended to gabble anyway.",agp lpl usually fly easyjet ryanair convenient time return malaga pay seat order print boarding pass leave home go hog pay priority boarding not encounter problem boarding agent arrive till minute gate officially close checking hand luggage dimension application rule allow bag onboard far passenger board struggle find locker space late night flight staff concerned get home quickly possible minute late take time en route cabin crew friendly work hard help passenger stow bag later serve refreshment etc overall relatively painless trip relaxing easyjet minor gripe leather seat unforgiving couple hour announcement cabin cockpit crew difficult hear ryanair boeing noisy easyjet airbus crew tend gabble,0.03603309020400047,0.12359584122896194,0.0970117375254631,0.02426724322140217,0.0019252009224146605,0.5229387283325195,0.1942281574010849,Topic_6

Found there are no better routes connecting SVQ and GOT/GSE these flights were the best option. As a point to point airline Ryanair never puts any responsibilities for any delays causing missed connections. We had a sharp 2 hrs at Paris to catch the next flight while the first flight from Seville was delayed a slightly over an hour due to extreme weather. You cannot expect a better pilot on SVQ-BVA route who was very informative and explained to us the delay causing him to change the parking three times and eventually used the airbridge. Flight from BVA was delayed allowing us to have an extra time. Return journey was fine. All in all very satisfied with the flights. We enjoyed both food along the way.

Ryanair customer review,First and last experience with this airline. Outward flight from Leeds Bradford to Chania was OK and if it had been the same on the return flight then we would have flown with them again. Check in at Chania was an absolute shambles made worse by the fact I'd bought a bouzouki in Crete and was unaware of Ryanair's attitude to musical instruments. At the check in I was obliged to pay 60 Euro and had to have it placed in the hold. I accept the fact that a musical instrument can be a bit of a hazard on a plane but it would have easily have fitted in the overhead locker. None of the cabin crew on the return flight had English as a first language and were unable to offer me concise instruction on how I was to claim the instrument at Leeds Bradford. The menus were in Euros yet the cabin crew asked for payment in sterling with the inevitable delay whilst currency conversions were carried out. This slowed the catering service down so much that it wasn't worth bothering with. We paid extra for priority boarding although this does not seem to offer any priority at check-in and is a complete waste of time at Chania as staff try and make as much bonus as they can by finding oversize and overweight hand luggage. We were ignored by ground staff when we tried to use the Priority lane. It's a case of first come first served until one of the check in staff decides to stem the flow and call the priority passengers forward. We also paid a premium for extra legroom in row 16. The extra legroom was appreciated but the seats are very narrow with fixed armrests and were not very comfortable at all. Also the cabin crew are ruthless about loose items in that seat row and my wife was made to wear a cardigan she had on her lap until the aircraft had taken off. No doubt there will be many who are obliged to use this carrier to visit family or their holiday homes abroad and they will have obviously conditioned themselves to flying with Ryanair but I can assure you that so long as there is a choice we will not be repeating the experience.,experience airline outward flight leed bradford chania ok return flight fly check chania absolute shamble bad fact d buy bouzouki crete unaware ryanair attitude musical instrument check oblige pay euro place hold accept fact musical instrument bit hazard plane easily fit overhead locker cabin crew return flight english language unable offer concise instruction claim instrument leed bradford menu euro cabin crew ask payment sterling inevitable delay whilst currency conversion carry slow catering service not worth bother pay extra priority boarding offer priority checkin complete waste time chania staff try bonus find oversize overweight hand luggage ignore ground staff try use priority lane case come serve check staff decide stem flow priority passenger forward pay premium extra legroom row extra legroom appreciate seat narrow fix armrest comfortable cabin crew ruthless loose item seat row wife wear cardigan lap aircraft take doubt oblige use carrier visit family holiday home abroad obviously condition fly ryanair assure long choice repeat experience,0.0016580709489062428,0.15079723298549652,0.08489363640546799,0.10177314281463623,0.03977743536233902,0.515306830406189,0.10579362511634827,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Flew STN-CIA-STN with flights on time for both parts of the journey. Everything was what one might expect of a low cost carrier so no surprises there. However I missed my first flight due to 'visa check' procedures they require for those who are not EU/EEA citizens. Even though I did not require a visa for either of my destinations their insistence on this was not the real problem however but that they had so few agents working that this process took much longer than the security check on both legs of my journey. So it really spoiled my experience (especially in missing my first flight which then caused me to incur additional charges to get onto the next flight) simply because they did not have enough agents working. Additionally because they made such a fuss over 'checking visas' I would have assumed they would be able to provide UK arrival cards on-board since they would know non EU/EEA citizens need these as I've always done this with any other flight instead of having to fill one out after landing. They however did not have these on the return flight which meant I spent even more time at the UK immigration check simply because they did not have them.,fly stnciastn flight time part journey expect low cost carrier surprise miss flight visa check procedure require eueea citizen require visa destination insistence real problem agent work process take long security check leg journey spoil experience especially miss flight cause incur additional charge flight simply agent work additionally fuss check visa assume able provide uk arrival card onboard know non eueea citizen need ve flight instead have fill land return flight mean spend time uk immigration check simply,0.003179658902809024,0.21355900168418884,0.21197129786014557,0.004311277996748686,0.019339900463819504,0.3556622564792633,0.1919766515493393,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Flew Frankfurt Hahn to Plovdiv and returned a couple of days later. The flights were on time and the planes were reasonably clean. We travelled with hand baggage only and didn't pay extra for seat allocation. We travel regularly with Ryanair and rarely experience problems - I find them more reliable than many other airlines. The return flight was 2 1/2 hours and I think that this is the limit that I'd be prepared to fly with Ryanair.

Ryanair customer review,I travelled from Frankfurt (HHN) to Stansted (STN). The flight was as good as any cheap airline. Can't say much about seat comfort or staff as you really don't expect that from them. Really new to the concept of bringing your own boarding pass from home and being charged if you don't. I'm pretty sure there will come a time when these airlines would want you to bring your own seatbelts and oxygen masks. The ground staff very strict for checking your baggage weight. First at the check-in then again after the security check which was an inconvenience and didn't really make sense. Overall it serves its purpose of getting you from point A to B.,travel frankfurt hhn stanste stn flight good cheap airline not seat comfort staff not expect new concept bring boarding pass home charge not m pretty sure come time airline want bring seatbelt oxygen mask ground staff strict check baggage weight checkin security check inconvenience not sense overall serve purpose get point b,0.02450414001941681,0.14407257735729218,0.16783787310123444,0.026086729019880295,0.0037383518647402525,0.40820610523223877,0.2255542278289795,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,"I'm a first time user of Ryanair. I don't mind that the plane is crowded or amenities are non-existent. I expected that at the price but I have a big gripe with their fees. I didn't know that boarding passes could not be printed at the airport. It was pointed out to me by the staff that the fine print does say I needed to print my pass. Also I was sent a warning email which I didn't see since I was in the middle of my vacation. Then I find the ""fee"" is 70 euros each for my wife and I. This isn't a fee this is a punishment. I sent a complaint letter to Ryanair and the response was that this charge was correct according to their policy. Well it isn't a very satisfactory policy.

Ryanair customer review,I fly all over the world and even use low cost regional airlines in the states but this takes the cake. Checked in online but couldn't print boarding pass. No notes online that there are huge fees to print at airport. There was no clear check in sign in Edinburgh but thankfully also no queue and 3 staff standing around chatting. When they finally decided to talk to us and tell us of the 20 pound check in fee they said they couldn't help us and we had to use the check in machine well across the way. The check in unit wouldn't process us and told us to see agent. The agent couldn't take our money and sent us all the way round to baggage to pay for boarding passes but then we had to take receipt back to first woman to get actual boarding card and drop prepaid bag! Our hand luggage was grabbed at the gate and we were made to pay £50 even though it was within weight. Flight was delayed an hour originally but left 2 hours late to Dublin.

Ryanair customer review,I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received on the evening of 26th Sep in Wroclaw airport related to a Ryanair flight. I paid extra for priority boarding both to and from Wroclaw. We departed from Cork last Sunday night and all was fine apart from minor delays at the final door prior to leaving the airport to make our way to the plane. On the other hand the service that we received in Wroclaw was an absolute disgrace. Both myself and my friend were the third and fourth in the queue went through the first check in gates to go down to the foyer leading to the Tarmac and plane. The other q passengers then went through their check in procedure. We all were massed in this small foyer for approx 20 mins and then they decided to open the gates and push approx 6 different families with buggies on top of us. Needless to say it was absolute bedlam by the time the doors were finally opened. There was an elderly Polish lady who had also paid for priority boarding who was pushed out of the way with the stampede to get to the plane. They really need to look at your procedures around check in and boarding as I have never experienced anything like this before. I would suggest that people with buggies should be checked in first and that these then should be placed in the foyer. The next passengers to be checked in should be priority passengers as after all they have paid for the privilege of this service! Finally the passengers who are in the alternative queue should then be checked in. The door should be manned to ensure that priority passengers are treated fairly.,extremely dissatisfied service receive evening th sep wroclaw airport relate ryanair flight pay extra priority boarding wroclaw depart cork sunday night fine apart minor delay final door prior leave airport way plane hand service receive wroclaw absolute disgrace friend fourth queue go check gate foyer lead tarmac plane q passenger go check procedure mass small foyer approx min decide open gate push approx different family buggy needless absolute bedlam time door finally open elderly polish lady pay priority boarding push way stampede plane need look procedure check boarding experience like suggest people buggy check place foyer passenger check priority passenger pay privilege service finally passenger alternative queue check door man ensure priority passenger treat fairly,0.01283347699791193,0.054917871952056885,0.13508747518062592,0.012537501752376556,0.03272922337055206,0.7206588387489319,0.031235577538609505,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,When travelling from Palma to Stansted I had a broken foot and was on crutches. Myself and an elderly lady with hip problems had booked assistance which didn't materialise. Last on the plane we were told that a) the booking hadn't been made (even though we produced our booking papers) and b) there were no wheelchairs available and we had to make it to the terminal under our own steam. As the next set of passengers were queuing at the foot of the steps we felt compelled to get off. No staff took responsibility for us once we were on the tarmac. Luckily a Stansted Airport employee was passing by the window and saw me struggling down the steps on crutches and rushed to our aid. She was horrified that we had been abandoned and quickly obtained wheelchairs for us both. Herself and a colleague took us all the way to the outside. No credit at all to Ryanair who's main objective was to get us off the plane so that the next flight could get under way.,travel palma stanste broken foot crutch elderly lady hip problem book assistance not materialise plane tell booking not produce booking paper b wheelchair available terminal steam set passenger queue foot step feel compel staff take responsibility tarmac luckily stansted airport employee pass window see struggle step crutch rush aid horrified abandon quickly obtain wheelchair colleague take way outside credit ryanair s main objective plane flight way,0.04049670323729515,0.09167297184467316,0.09550737589597702,0.004960236139595509,0.07967391610145569,0.6181044578552246,0.06958430260419846,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Actual flight both ways was good but the handling at Stansted and Rhodes wasn't. We felt like cattle not customers. Stansted we were held up getting to airport we had priority booking but had to wait with everyone else as priority queue had gone therefore one of the cabin bags had to go in the hold. At Rhodes we were first to check-in and they took the first 90 cabin bags in the hold. Surely it should be the last? There seems no reason now to take cabin bags at all! The benefit apart from the cost is that you can exit the airport much quicker at your destination. Waiting for cabin bags takes as long as waiting for large luggage. The overhead luggage compartments were half empty. It just seems like another Ryanair useless rule.,actual flight way good handling stanste rhode not feel like cattle customer stanste hold get airport priority booking wait priority queue go cabin bag hold rhode checkin take cabin bag hold surely reason cabin bag benefit apart cost exit airport quick destination wait cabin bag take long wait large luggage overhead luggage compartment half like ryanair useless rule,0.003369474085047841,0.25608083605766296,0.11278556287288666,0.004567684140056372,0.002870808122679591,0.5613821148872375,0.058943554759025574,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Flew Ryanair many times however most common route I fly is KIR-LTN. Most recent flight SNN-SXF. Ryanair is a very good airline in my opinion. Despite flying to airports that only the CIA has heard of and advertising the airport for the capital city of Slovenia (it's Bratislava) as Vienna it's very handy. I use it often and I have never had a problem with Ryanair. Even with hidden fees tickets for me seem cheaper than Aer Lingus. The aircraft are clean but still somewhat dark and gloomy and the seats are uncomfortable horrible on a late-night flights or dawn when you try and catch some sleep however still possible. The snacks and drinks on board are still a reasonable price and the crew are friendly. The toilets are excellent being bright and clean.

Ryanair customer review,Flight number FR694 on the 6th of September from Prestwick UK to Ibiza Spain. The majority of passengers onboard this drink fuelled flight were unruly drunken and aggressive towards other passengers despite the best efforts of the 4 onboard cabin crew. Language throughout was absolutely foul. As a grandmother travelling with 2 young infants under the age of four the condition experienced in the cabin were shocking. Passengers were swearing were drinking open duty free were throwing objects from in front and behind us. Safety announcements could not be heard as passengers were playing music from bluetooth devices and the cabin was totally out of control. Cabin crew were very concerned however despite the best efforts to contain behaviour there was no way they could control the passengers. The crew threatened to divert the aircraft to France and also threatened the majority of passengers with the police meeting them on arrival at the destination. The main point is that safety notices were completely ignored myself and my family felt totally unsafe during the flight. My grand-daughters aged two and three have never been exposed to such outrageous language and behaviour - the conditions on this flight were not safe and were not suitable for a family. Access to toilets involved standing for 40 minutes in crowds of alcohol fuelled louts. Many of the passengers boarded the flight inebriated one group drank a litre bottle of duty free vodka onboard the flight whilst throwing coins around the cabin. We are feeling extremely anxious about our return journey.,flight number fr th september prestwick uk ibiza spain majority passenger onboard drink fuel flight unruly drunken aggressive passenger despite good effort onboard cabin crew language absolutely foul grandmother travel young infant age condition experience cabin shock passenger swear drink open duty free throw object safety announcement hear passenger play music bluetooth device cabin totally control cabin crew concerned despite good effort contain behaviour way control passenger crew threaten divert aircraft france threaten majority passenger police meet arrival destination main point safety notice completely ignore family feel totally unsafe flight granddaughter age expose outrageous language behaviour condition flight safe suitable family access toilet involve stand minute crowd alcohol fuel lout passenger board flight inebriate group drink litre bottle duty free vodka onboard flight whilst throw coin cabin feel extremely anxious return journey,0.049016281962394714,0.07287051528692245,0.04184446856379509,0.019953342154622078,0.06627992540597916,0.5790299773216248,0.1710055023431778,Topic_6

When she left Shannon all was well until her return flight home from Tenerife. 6.30 am she checked in for the free allocation of seats they were allocated separate seats opposite side aisles. My daughter went early to the departures queue and boarded one of the first after priority boarding and explained to one of the crew they told her to take her seats and they would try to change her once they were in the air. I find this quite incredible for a flight to take off with a 2 year old baby sat on her own.

Did not expect much but I was quite impressed with them. I work as Cabin Crew so I do know how to travel with a low cost carrier. I paid the extra 10eur for a seat on the first row. Extremely comfortable and thanks to the included priority boarding hassle free experience in the airport. My bag was a bit bigger (the side which was supposed to be just 20cm was slightly larger did not experience any problem). Staff extremely polite and professional both in the airport and in the air.

Ryanair customer review,We flew to Gran Canaria as a family of four this month - never again with Ryanair! At 6ft tall there is no way to sit comfortably in the tiny amount of legroom you are allocated. The plane itself looked tired and dirty and the toilets are a disgrace. The cabin crew are ok and do the best they can and were friendly but the food / drinks are shockingly bad and the coffee is not fit for human consumption!

Ryanair customer review,I fly Ryanair and easyjet to Malaga from Liverpool every 2 weeks and have done so for 2.5 years. The service from both is good and Ryanair are normally the cheapest. I have had 3 delays due to weather and one diversion to East Midlands last year due to the weather. I do hear complaints every now and then on flights for both airlines the majority by people who are not seasoned travellers and only fly on limited occasions. The complaints were mostly why cant I sit at the front because they see these seats are free but they are told you cant have these seats as the aircraft needs to be balanced. Most accept this others don't and they hold the queue up by arguing. Then you get the guy and his mate who hover around the extra leg room seats to see if they can get one and they block the aisles and hold the queue up. Now that allocated seating is on all aircraft these problems seem to be resolved apart from the odd idiot who says I want to sit next to my mate but we did not get that option when we booked so can you sort it this again holds the queue up. With regards to the aircraft staff yes they have their bad days but that is not surprising as they see the same type of idiots flying in and flying out. The expression you pay peanuts you get monkeys however does not apply to the majority of staff I have come across and the vast majority of regular travellers appreciate the stewards and the service they give. If you wish for a better service then dig deep and save up for the next ten years and you can fly business class.,fly ryanair easyjet malaga liverpool week year service good ryanair normally cheap delay weather diversion east midland year weather hear complaint flight airline majority people season traveller fly limited occasion complaint not sit seat free tell not seat aircraft need balance accept not hold queue argue guy mate hover extra leg room seat block aisle hold queue allocate seating aircraft problem resolve apart odd idiot say want sit mate option book sort hold queue regard aircraft staff yes bad day surprising type idiot fly fly expression pay peanut monkey apply majority staff come vast majority regular traveller appreciate steward service wish well service dig deep save year fly business class,0.052241064608097076,0.08293615281581879,0.09385921061038971,0.08316417783498764,0.02367766574025154,0.47302553057670593,0.19109618663787842,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Business plus plan: Smoke and Mirrors. I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard. Bottom Line: Business plus plan is a total fake intended to take more money out of business passengers without giving them anything.,business plus plan smoke mirror go business trip take opportunity travel ryanair new business plus plan aside fly regularly ryanair choice usually book pay option go option package promise bit cost euro flight dublin nice france offering flexibility ticket change kg baggage allowance fast track airport security priority boarding choose premium seat pretty good buy need use standard want dublin airport gate people let fast lane clearance big deal come return flight option standard nice let check time queue priority passenger way ensue melee herd aboard couple bus priority standard line business plus plan total fake intend money business passenger give,0.002486833371222019,0.04227055609226227,0.2174050360918045,0.014563513919711113,0.01348346658051014,0.554602861404419,0.15518778562545776,Topic_6

The staff at the back of the plane frequently came to the front as they were having some kind of disagreement and arguing over some gossip from another flight attendant that was not present during our flight. It was a he said she said thing that involved all of them. My partner and I were not able to get seats together when I booked for extra leg room for us both so we had aisle seats however the 2 seats in front of my partner were empty and it would have been nice for attendants to have offered us the seats so as we could sit together.

Ryanair customer review,I have flown Ryanair many times over the last few years and never really had a bad experience though it was clear they were pushing the low cost model to extremes. My most recent trip was the first since their change of direction and things have improved: best is reserved seats which makes boarding much more civilised the selling of food and other items seems lower key and the 'another on-time arrival' jingle is less irritating than it was - though I could still live without it. It is still a fairly basic service but not too dissimilar from that offered by other carriers on intra-European routes. Ryanair finally seems to be aware of what attracts customers apart from low fares and is addressing some of the issues I hope it continues.,fly ryanair time year bad experience clear push low cost model extreme recent trip change direction thing improve good reserve seat make boarding civilised selling food item low key ontime arrival jingle irritating live fairly basic service dissimilar offer carrier intraeuropean route ryanair finally aware attract customer apart low fare address issue hope continue,0.0038093493785709143,0.038924358785152435,0.10111729055643082,0.024283146485686302,0.0493149571120739,0.58866947889328,0.19388146698474884,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,FR5579 21 July returned 28 July on FR5578. My family and I travelled to Benidorm for 7 days. Our travel with Ryanair was less than perfect. On the flight over I ordered a small bottle of Prosecco the flight attendant went for ice and when she returned she knocked over the ice and in an attempt to catch it she knocked the bottle over which spilled over me. She did not apologise until about 15 minutes later and at the time she just picked up the bottle and said it is only a little amount. I had to get up and go to the bathroom to try and soak up some of the wine. Thankfully it was white wine. On our return flight I badly needed to go to the toilet the flight attendant was talking for a while with the co-pilot and finally I had to stand up. I was told from the toilet to sit down I was again told to sit as the co-pilot had to use the bathroom which he did however when he came out they again continued talking. I again stood up to be told sit again but this time she then indicated I use the rear toilet as the captain was to use the front facility also. (I was in row 9). As I approached the rear toilet the flight attendant there told me to go back to my seat I had to sit down the fasten your seatbelt sign was on I tried to explain and eventually stressed I had to use the toilet “now”. Then the attendant from the front called the rear and said to let me use the toilet which I did. The was very stressful especially in front of all the other people on board I do understand the need for safety on board a plane however the f act the staff have extended conversations amongst themselves as opposed to taking care of their paying clients speaks volumes. I will avoid using this airline again if at all possible I am extremely disappointed.,fr july return july fr family travel benidorm day travel ryanair perfect flight order small bottle prosecco flight attendant go ice return knock ice attempt catch knock bottle spill apologise minute later time pick bottle say little bathroom try soak wine thankfully white wine return flight badly need toilet flight attendant talk copilot finally stand tell toilet sit tell sit copilot use bathroom come continue talk stand tell sit time indicate use rear toilet captain use facility row approach rear toilet flight attendant tell seat sit fasten seatbelt sign try explain eventually stress use toilet attendant call rear say let use toilet stressful especially people board understand need safety board plane f act staff extend conversation oppose take care pay client speak volume avoid airline possible extremely disappointed,0.029300397261977196,0.04191811382770538,0.14685779809951782,0.055231980979442596,0.0015928247012197971,0.644406795501709,0.0806921198964119,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,My experience of Ryanair was negative. The only saving grace for the company was the onboard staff particularly the chief steward who was polite friendly and helpful. The online booking I found absolutely puzzling. I travelled with Monarch on my outward journey which was straightforward and cheaper. As I was travelling around for a month beforehand the policy of having to print off the return boarding pass the week before you travel is ridiculous! The fact that if you can't do it you're charged is appalling! When I arrived to check in I was informed I had no baggage therefore I had to pay £35 more! The way I was told was very abrupt. My family with 2 young children had no seat allocation so had to wait for it to be sorted out. This despite having paid for the flight. Our checking in took in total over an hour!

The inflight service began with drinks and snacks. I had a pepsi which was in a small can. Then the duty free service before rubbish during our decent over London. We landed just before 10.45 10 mins early. Yet again no fanfare but a little announcement about there low fares and the fact they have a 90% punctuality record.

Ryanair customer review,My journey from Stansted to Ibiza was ruined by drunken stag party members whose behaviour was completely disregarded by the air crew. It was evident from the beginning when the crew did a half-hearted safety demonstration that no-one had authority to run this flight. Passengers became increasingly distressed as the stag party shouted and swore aggressively ran up and down the aisles and openly drank from bottles of vodka while standing behind Ryanair staff. The crew evidently avoided eye contact no public announcements were made to warn them of the consequences and when I complained that the situation wasn't being managed staff simply ignored me. Although they did drag their feet bringing the trolley down the aisle they eventually served these men even more alcohol. This was a potentially very dangerous situation. On landing all of the men (aside from one who was incoherent and staggering) behaved perfectly properly as they exited through security to avoid arrest which suggests that they would have responded to warnings about their conduct during the flight.,journey stanste ibiza ruin drunken stag party member behaviour completely disregard air crew evident beginning crew halfhearted safety demonstration authority run flight passenger increasingly distressed stag party shout swear aggressively run aisle openly drink bottle vodka stand ryanair staff crew evidently avoid eye contact public announcement warn consequence complain situation not manage staff simply ignore drag foot bring trolley aisle eventually serve man alcohol potentially dangerous situation land man aside incoherent staggering behave perfectly properly exit security avoid arrest suggest respond warning conduct flight,0.07543180137872696,0.0191048476845026,0.09640266001224518,0.04534250125288963,0.002353857271373272,0.6857938170433044,0.07557056844234467,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,We have flown Ryanair many times without problems. If you know what to expect then you wont get disappointed. However upon arriving at East Midlands airport for our flight to Tenerife South recently with plenty of time to spare we found that there were 12 flights departing at roughly the same time. 12 flights of people that needed to check in and clear security before boarding. It seems that Ryanair just bung everyone together regardless of which flight you are on Some people were panicking as their flight was taking off soon and were stuck at check in when asked to jump the queue were told they would have to wait like everyone else! It took us 2 hours to get through check in and clear security. Queues were snaked round the airport (although admittedly this is not Ryanair's fault!) but a better system needs put in place for Ryanair check in. We managed to get to the boarding gates just in time albeit at the end of the queue. There we were kept waiting for 20 minutes as staff now needed hand luggage to put on the hold. The staff member was very aggressive and rude to us trying to grab our bags to put in the hold we told her that we needed the bags for inflight and one contained valuables that we wanted to keep with us. She tried to snatch my husbands backpack from his back and took my daughters small suitcase from her before I took it back. We eventually offered one bag but I had to remove everything that was needed and carry it in my hands she wouldn't even give us a carrier bag. She went up and down the last remaining passengers trying to grab peoples hand luggage but as nobody else would offer a bag she came back to us telling us she needed our bags we refused but She wasn't having any of it and barked at us we didn't have a choice as we were at the end of the queue and if we didn't put our hand luggage in the hold we would be fined £60. Her attitude was appalling and if she'd have asked politely we may have tried our best to accommodate her request. She wouldn't let the last people through the departure gate thus holding up the flight until she had the bags But no way were we giving up our remaining (small) bags. We eventually got on the bus to the plane and on the flight there we sat for another 20 minutes before actually taking off! It was never made clear that only the first 60 passengers were guaranteed to take their hand luggage. Yet on our return flight home everything was smooth queues moved quickly and staff were very pleasant helpful and polite. We packed our bags accordingly and offered our hand luggage for the hold.

Ryanair customer review,I use Ryanair regularly flying from Dublin to the Netherlands. You get what you pay for. Fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. The staff aren't particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. Upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. This often leads to a push when getting off. To avoid this I remain seated until people have started getting off. Because of the short turn around time it isn't unusual to find some else's rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so it's caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline. Overall if you just want to get there on time and you are not concerned about the service fly Ryanair.,use ryanair regularly fly dublin netherlands pay fast boarding flight reasonable service quickly terminal plane arrive staff not particularly friendly clearly look pressure entire flight reach gate flight attendant tell passenger minute plane turn quickly door open lead push get avoid remain seat people start get short turn time not unusual find else rubbish seat pocket flight attendant round rubbish bag end flight cause inconsiderate passenger airline overall want time concerned service fly ryanair,0.016988543793559074,0.0473901703953743,0.07606279850006104,0.07126184552907944,0.0025907752569764853,0.6629005670547485,0.12280529737472534,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Last flew with Ryanair 10th and 15th Aug 2014 LPL-BCN-LPL. Excellent flights both ways - an unexpected bonus was getting premium seats and priority boarding at no extra cost when we checked in online two days before flying. Cabin crew courteous and friendly and both flights although each about 10 mins late pushing back from stand landed on time. Use Ryanair about 12 times a year and have never had a bad flight except for one (MAN-FAO Feb 2014) which was delayed because of storms which affected all flights to Southern Europe that evening. Crew were trying to be helpful but abusive and drunken behaviour from a mixed group of twenty something's caused us to miss our revised take-off slot while the police removed them. As long as you read the website carefully and follow the booking and check-in instructions Take a bit of responsibility for your own arrangements then there shouldn't be a problem - although it never ceases to amaze me how many people forget to pack their brains when they travel.,fly ryanair th th aug lplbcnlpl excellent flight way unexpected bonus get premium seat priority boarding extra cost check online day fly cabin crew courteous friendly flight min late push stand land time use ryanair time year bad flight manfao feb delay storm affect flight southern europe evening crew try helpful abusive drunken behaviour mixed group something cause miss revise takeoff slot police remove long read website carefully follow booking checkin instruction bit responsibility arrangement not problem cease amaze people forget pack brain travel,0.0029261598829180002,0.04441814124584198,0.24220150709152222,0.003957648295909166,0.05172288790345192,0.4711426794528961,0.1836310178041458,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,9th August FR8241. Have just come back from Mallorca having flown for the first time with Ryanair. Have to admit was very worried due to comments made about flying with this airline. We found the check in lady very pleasant and kind who made checking in our luggage very easy. The aircrew were helpful and cheerful and although we were late leaving by 30 minutes could not have served us any better. It was very busy at Mallorca airport on our departure and we had a bit of a wait in the queue but this was because most people had not checked the weight of their luggage so were re-packing.

The stewardess immediately apologised and offered me an extra 10% off perfumes which I did not use. Also in the row behind us was three kids (in three seats with no adults) one young child proceeded to kick my partners chair rather violently whilst the parents were relaxing with headphones on unaware to their child's misbehaviour again a quick word to the stewardess and an adult was moved beside the children and the mischief stopped.

Ryanair customer review,This airline continues to show it has no interest in customer service or staff training. Only bottom line. After arriving at Stansted 3 hours before the flight was due to depart we arrived at the boarding gate during final flight call. Why? Because of the throng of people Ryanair euphemistically call a queue attempting to check- in their bags at their bag-drops manned by the Ryanair Gestapo. It appears these rude unhelpful staff's main training was on extracting extra cash wherever it is physically possible. To watch so many people removing items from hold bags only to add them to their cabin luggage is farcical. Or would be if it wasn't so sad. In my own case my bag was 5kg under and my travelling partner's was nearly 1kg over. No problem you would think there is still a net difference of -4kg. But no as the tickets weren't booked on the same reference number we were deemed to be travelling separately. Even though we had booked seat numbers next to each other and paid the extra we were still flying separately according to the misery behind the counter. Ok so it's no real effort to undo her bag remove a few bits and put them into the bag you are going to take into the cabin with you. But multiply that with the amount of people doing the same and you soon end up with massive queues. And both bags are going onto the plane anyway! Fortunately flying back was with EasyJet who managed the same procedure in less than 15 minutes. I know who I will always use in the future.,airline continue interest customer service staff training line arrive stansted hour flight depart arrive boarding gate final flight throng people ryanair euphemistically queue attempt check bag bagdrop man ryanair gestapo appear rude unhelpful staff main training extract extra cash physically possible watch people remove item hold bag add cabin luggage farcical not sad case bag kg travel partner nearly kg problem think net difference kg ticket not book reference number deem travel separately book seat number pay extra fly separately accord misery counter ok real effort undo bag remove bit bag go cabin multiply people soon end massive queue bag go plane fortunately fly easyjet manage procedure minute know use future,0.0021462326403707266,0.1666339784860611,0.16459335386753082,0.033059075474739075,0.046241290867328644,0.5705541968345642,0.01677185669541359,Topic_6

So in effect you are being charged for having your bag with you. I am a regular traveller so don't take hold luggage to avoid the waiting at the destination.

All flights were late leaving but made up time except for the Poitiers- Stansted leg which was delayed by 1 hour due to a passenger injury at boarding time.

Transfer went very smoothly. However Hertz told me that they did not have an office in Poitiers and my only option was to cancel which I did only to be charged a 50 euro cancellation fee even though I had booked through Ryanair.

Ryanair customer review,Dortmund-Krakow RTN. Avoided Ryanair because of their aggressive policy but decided to give them a try again. Finally Ryanair has understood that free seating leading to a scrum has had its longest time. The allocated seating for decent fees is a big improvement. Onboard only harassed once for a lottery. No constant announcements for buying this and that anymore. Leg room stays a problem though as they press 198 passengers into a Boeing 737-800. Wouldn't bear a FR-flight longer than two hours. All in all a decent experience for less than 200 euro rtn for two including bag priority boarding - worked well but isn't really necessary anymore with allocated seating - and reserved seat. If you reserve a seat at the time of booking you can can check in 30 days prior to departure.

There are no internet cafes in Sliema Malta so thought would print off boarding pass at machine at the airport. On arriving at Malta airport 2 hours 20 minutes before my flight a particularly grumpy Ryanair agent took up 10 minutes of my time telling me I was too late and should have done this in Malta (How exactly if there are no internet cafes and you do not stay in a hotel?) before finally pointing me towards the computer where I could do this. This touchscreen computer was slow and unresponsive and so I was 2 minutes late to meet the 2 hour deadline because of this woman's complete lack of customer service. An EUR 140 fee and a horrible stressful end to the holiday. What gets me is that I knew I had to print the boarding pass off 2 hours before and made a fair effort to do so leaving 20 minutes to do this on arrival at the airport. I noticed Lufthansa had dedicated machines clearly visible for this purpose. I had to beg this woman to tell me where was the Ryan Air machine before she pointed it out to me all the while telling me I was too late etc when I still had time. However reading other reviews it looks as if even if I had been at the airport much earlier that the fee might still have been charged.

Ryanair customer review,London (Stansted) to Bremen (Germany) return. Beware of Ryanair suitcase check-in/drop off unless you want to risk missing your flight. Checked-in online with only a trundle. Drove from Leicester to Stansted. Arrived 2 hours before the flight and were met with chaos as my niece (on same flight with us) who had come to visit needed to drop off her suitcase (also already checked-in online). Passengers of numerous flights had all been lumped together into one disorientated heap of people with check-in operating at slow pace. The usual clue as to the destination above the relevant individual check-in desks was not there and was replaced by one single queue/lump of chaos. One distraught couple told me that they had already been queuing for 40 minutes at the wrong Ryanair desk round the corner. I asked a passing Ryanair staff if we were in the right queue (although it was hard to describe it as such) and pointed out that our flight was about to close. He confirmed we were. 15 minutes later he asked passengers for the Bremen flight to come forward. Our flight had already closed whilst at security which was as chaotic. Mercifully the flight was late taking off. I have never experienced in all my years of travelling to all the continents on the globe such chaos stress and anxiety. There was nothing leisurely about this trip. We had to run (it was very hot) all the way through corridors and shops only to be met by a train (not a gate) taking us to the gates. We were lucky that our gate was in the thirties not seventies as we would have missed our flight for sure. In the end we arrived breathless hot and sweating in front of another lump/queue of passengers with just enough time to use the toilet. I should also mention that the word priority on your check-in paper does not mean a thing.

Ryanair customer review,Have flown with Ryanair on numerous occasions across Europe and in 20+ flights have never had a problem. You get what you pay for and as long as you read the small print and stick to their rules you can't go far wrong. My wife and I even used them on our honeymoon! It's worth doing your revision before you fly and check on destination airports and onward travel links on your arrival as some Ryanair destination airports can be a little out of the way.

Ryanair customer review,Stansted to La Rochelle. Got to airport around 3 hours before departure and as we had no baggage we went through security. Security took 27 mins. Unacceptable. Then we waited for around for 90 mins before flight was called and we went to gate 44 immediately. As being called 40 mins before and getting to gate 35 mins before we thought the plane would be there in 10 mins. It wasn't and was there no earlier than 25 mins of waiting at the gate. We were rushed on to the steps to Tarmac whist pax where deboarding and we where on it around 3 mins before our scheduled departure time. We where off 15 mins behind schedule. The flight was smooth and fine. I had a Pepsi and just looked out of the window no IFE or food. We sat in row 5 and had priority boarding. The aircraft landed 10 mins early and we had the usual fanfare. We where de boarded quickly and went straight through to meet relatives who have a 2nd home and took our bags with them. La Rochelle to Stansted. We got there 2 hours 15 mins before flight and we went through security. Relatives driving back took bags with them. There is 1 duty free shop and a cafe. There where 2 aircraft departing at same time and being the first in the lounge gets us a seat. (La Rochelle gets overcrowded). The aircraft got in 10 mins early but the other Brussels flight was late. Boarding began 10 mins before departure and we where off just after the Brussels 15 mins behind. The flight was ok. My seat was dirty and had gum under the seat in front. Again row 5 and priority boarding.

Ryanair customer review,I had a “neutral” flying experience with Ryanair (July 2014). This was a real surprise. I see that the staff have new marching orders and that intimidation is no longer the order of the day. This new more normal”attitude is already being noticed. Passengers are already taking liberties with hand luggage it will probably not be long before a new clampdown” will be enforced and unpleasant situations will once again be splattered all over the review sites. I made sure I had ticked all the boxes and weighed in before travelling this time. My previous experience has made me paranoid”about using this airline. I would have preferred not to have used Ryanair. They offered the best price for the trip and as money is tight I was compelled to take the risk. We can remain optimistic and hope they carry on in this manner. Perhaps in 3 to 5 years they will have a positive reputation. I still have reservations Ryanair inflicted such needless blow to my family that I am afraid to say it will never be forgiven. In the meantime I will reluctantly use the airline when needed and hope for more uneventful flights.,neutral flying experience ryanair july real surprise staff new marching order intimidation long order day new normalattitude notice passenger take liberty hand luggage probably long new clampdown enforce unpleasant situation splatter review site sure tick box weigh travel time previous experience paranoidabout airline prefer ryanair offer good price trip money tight compel risk remain optimistic hope carry manner year positive reputation reservation ryanair inflict needless blow family afraid forgive meantime reluctantly use airline need hope uneventful flight,0.0029986663721501827,0.11114715784788132,0.1308058202266693,0.10801757127046585,0.002553563565015793,0.5318533778190613,0.11262389272451401,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Flight FR 2132 - an number I will never forget. 2nd time with Ryanair and first time although no real problems felt like we were treated as second class citizens so vowed never to book with them again. However family holiday to Lanzarote and the only people flying out in the morning (so we arrive before lunch) was Ryanair. So I hesitantly booked (even though it was no cheaper than the other airlines). First came the con where you can no longer print your boarding passes (unless you have paid the extra for allocated seating) until 14 days before you return date. As this was a 2 week holiday I was already at the airport catching my flight out so had to pay for allocated seating. This was just a snippet of what was to come. The flight out was cattle market heaven but quite uneventful so consoled myself with the fact that I had done the right thing and would have an extra half day holiday by flying out early. The flight home was the nightmare we were called to our gate then the gate changed twice so the long queue of people were already irate when there was a general murmur around the crowd. This was when the first person had received a text to say the flight had been delayed due to technical issues and we had a delay of over 5 hours. Not told anything by the staff on the ground the whole airport became Chinese whispers. In total I had 4 texts from Ryanair delaying the flight eventually by 12 hours. We did not arrive home until 5am. I feel like I now need another holiday after spending 15 hours in a very hot uncomfortable airport and then a further 4 hour flight home.,flight fr number forget nd time ryanair time real problem feel like treat second class citizen vow book family holiday lanzarote people fly morning arrive lunch ryanair hesitantly book cheap airline come con long print boarding pass pay extra allocate seating day return date week holiday airport catch flight pay allocate seating snippet come flight cattle market heaven uneventful console fact right thing extra half day holiday fly early flight home nightmare call gate gate change twice long queue people irate general murmur crowd person receive text flight delay technical issue delay hour tell staff ground airport chinese whisper total text ryanair delay flight eventually hour arrive home feel like need holiday spend hour hot uncomfortable airport hour flight home,0.002163513330742717,0.025663381442427635,0.21452338993549347,0.013383971527218819,0.0018426827155053616,0.7142466306686401,0.028176411986351013,Topic_6

I have always been able to take my hand luggage in the correct size bag on board without any problems. Today however I was waiting to board the flight at Skavsta Airport when then airport staff start walking along the line of people waiting and randomly telling passengers the flight was full and the had to put their hand luggage in the main hold. When I pointed out that I had some breakable goods in my bag I was told that if I was that worried I should had been in the queue earlier. As it happened There were about 10 people in the non-priority queue ahead of me. Also my travel companion was at the end of the queue but was allowed to take his bag same size as mine on board without problems. There was no logic at all. TO me it seems like the only way to guarantee that you can bring your hand luggage on board is to pay the ""priority boarding"" fee.

Ryanair customer review,Having been put off using Ryanair about 4 years ago I took a flight from Bristol to Girona and return early July 2014. I was well aware of all the pitfalls and extra charges and then made the mistake of mis-spelling my own first name. I thought 'here we go' especially as I couldn't get through on the phone even the £1.09 a minute line. Then I stumbled upon their 'live chat' facility got connected within 2 minutes and had the name corrected. They emailed me a revised confirmation. Of the flights - well the pre-allocated seats are a great improvement - saves that awful scramble on board with the FAs screaming 'if you don't sit down we'll lose our flight slot' and passengers coming to blows. The boarding pass saying front or rear of the plane is sensible. Unlike previous flights (which was what finally put me off Ryanair) there were no cases either at BRS or GRO of passengers being harassed having their luggage weighed or measured or any sign of people being charged for things. Most notably I didn't hear any passengers grumbling about anything. So the simple impression of just 2 flights is that you get what you pay for on-time clean planes and a vast improvement from 4 (plus) years ago. Whether I want to brave a STN flight is debatable but I need to fly home later in the year and I won't be too worried.,have ryanair year ago take flight bristol girona return early july aware pitfall extra charge mistake misspell think especially not phone minute line stumble live chat facility get connect minute correct email revise confirmation flight preallocate seat great improvement save awful scramble board fas scream not sit lose flight slot passenger come blow boarding pass say rear plane sensible unlike previous flight finally ryanair case brs gro passenger harass have luggage weigh measure sign people charge thing notably not hear passenger grumble simple impression flight pay ontime clean plane vast improvement plus year ago want brave stn flight debatable need fly home later year will not worried,0.07015000283718109,0.1747976839542389,0.14550086855888367,0.032007310539484024,0.002081578364595771,0.4033278226852417,0.17213474214076996,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,On March 30th 2014 we flew Ryanair our of Beauvais France (BVA) to Madrid Spain. The tickets sounded like a great deal until we got to the airport and found out we had to pay another $140 euro for boarding passes. The rep at the counter all of a sudden did not speak English or Spanish was rude and started to roll her eyes. We paid the additional charge and went back to check our luggage. We then were told there were more charges for our bag (under weight) that were not included apparently. We paid the extra fees and finally were told we could get in line. We proceeded to get in line which was a huge disaster and with no logic or system in place or completely poorly executed and took 2 hours. The lines began to severely back up they began shifting customers back and forth between lines and ultimately the plane had to leave late. Once on the plane the conditions and cleanliness of the plane were noticeably lacking and even a few pieces were broken. Refreshments were offered at unreasonable prices. The pilot must have been new because the entire flight was filled with drastic turns turbulence and ultimately. We couldn't wait to get off the plane. We had to wait another 45 minutes in baggage claim before our luggage began to roll. I will never use this airline again.,march th fly ryanair beauvais france bva madrid spain ticket sound like great deal get airport find pay euro boarding pass rep counter sudden speak english spanish rude start roll eye pay additional charge go check luggage tell charge bag weight include apparently pay extra fee finally tell line proceed line huge disaster logic system place completely poorly execute take hour line begin severely begin shift customer forth line ultimately plane leave late plane condition cleanliness plane noticeably lack piece break refreshment offer unreasonable price pilot new entire flight fill drastic turn turbulence ultimately not wait plane wait minute baggage claim luggage begin roll use airline,0.01174343004822731,0.20548906922340393,0.21012280881404877,0.0028544014785438776,0.012248710729181767,0.485819935798645,0.0717216432094574,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Ryanair does not allow you to get boarding passes for the return flights straightforwardly at the same time as for the outward flight although within the 30 day period. This resulted in a £70 charge for each of our return flights. A lot of people seem to have been caught out by this see other reviews. This seems to be a new practice and I could not recommend Ryanair to anyone in future since there is a real risk that their holiday will be ruined as a result of this disgusting sharp practice. I could not help noticing that the return fight was not full and would not be surprised if fights are even emptier in future.,ryanair allow boarding pass return flight straightforwardly time outward flight day period result charge return flight lot people catch review new practice recommend ryanair future real risk holiday ruin result disgusting sharp practice help notice return fight surprised fight empty future,0.004990049172192812,0.15844225883483887,0.1579439491033554,0.006764634978026152,0.004251508973538876,0.5950832366943359,0.07252436131238937,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,"Flew 05/06/14 STN to SNN. Had a horrible start to my journey thanks to the Stansted Express service on which I was stuck for 2 hours due to technical difficulties. Missed my flight as a result and Ryanair transferred me free of charge to the next flight which was the following morning. Very much appreciated considering it was not their fault I missed the flight. I needed to make it back to Shannon for a trans-atlantic flight the following afternoon so they saved my holiday from being cancelled. This along with the various upgrades to their service in the past 12 months (additional carry on bag reserved seating etc) have made Ryanair my choice of airline when flying from London. Customer service is dramatically improving in my opinion and as long as you know how they operate and how the pricing structure works then there shouldn't be any issues when flying with them. I'm not sure how so many people are allowed to leave bad reviews on here when the source of their problem is very often the customer being at fault and not adhering to the ""rules of low-cost flying""!",fly stn snn horrible start journey thank stansted express service stick hour technical difficulty miss flight result ryanair transfer free charge flight follow morning appreciated consider fault miss flight need shannon transatlantic flight follow afternoon save holiday cancel upgrade service past month additional carry bag reserve seating etc ryanair choice airline fly london customer service dramatically improve opinion long know operate pricing structure work not issue fly m sure people allow leave bad review source problem customer fault adhere rule lowcost fly,0.0029410102870315313,0.10676567256450653,0.23279912769794464,0.004288974218070507,0.0025050167459994555,0.611152172088623,0.03954802826046944,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,We were due to fly to Fuerteventura on 24th June flight FR3525 from Luton. After sitting in the plane on the tarmac for 2.5 hours they decided to cancel the flight for operational reasons.

We re-booked with Jet2 for the following Saturday (only about £15 dearer) and received excellent service.

This was a mid vacation excursion. We found out that they can't print boarding passes for anything less then £70 each. We also found out that they can't actually handle the money for the outrageous bag fee. We missed our flight and had to rebook. The whole adventure ended up costing an additional £450.

Ryanair customer review,We went with 6 people (4 adults and 2 children). We accidentally had two pieces of luggage too much (this was our own fault) so we paid the extra other airlines do the same so its not just Ryanair. Boarding was very smooth and the children received special attention from a friendly crew member. Plane landed on time in Rome. Return was about the same. I fly regularly with Ryanair and I never had any problems. Delays are hardly the mistake of the airline but of the airport and the airport handling so you cannot blame them for that. Also people flying with Ryanair don't want to pay much for their tickets but they complain about the people paying the extras like priority boarding. Some passengers not paying for the extras were complaining why we could get on first! Also if you preselect your seat with a small extra you can print your boarding pass (also for the return flight) at home. Even with all the extras Ryanair was the cheapest solution. So to be frankly not Ryanair is the problem but some people flying with Ryanair are. Ryanair is very clear about their rules and I really don't understand why people don't obbey them? Do they do it on purpose maybe hoping they get the full service and not paying for it? I like Ryanair they bring you very safely from A to B for very little money. I don't expect much from them but I am always surprised they give good service for the money you pay.,go people adult child accidentally piece luggage fault pay extra airline ryanair boarding smooth child receive special attention friendly crew member plane land time rome return fly regularly ryanair problem delay hardly mistake airline airport airport handling blame people fly ryanair not want pay ticket complain people pay extra like priority boarding passenger pay extra complain preselect seat small extra print boarding pass return flight home extras ryanair cheap solution frankly ryanair problem people fly ryanair ryanair clear rule not understand people not obbey purpose maybe hope service pay like ryanair bring safely b little money not expect surprised good service money pay,0.014363654889166355,0.06575161218643188,0.1778719425201416,0.015132611617445946,0.0021469818893820047,0.5732114911079407,0.1515217274427414,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,"If anyone is every considering flying with Ryanair ensure you know exactly what experience you are signing up for when you book your ticket. We went return from Luton to Marrakech and would not do this journey with them again. In fact we'd only think about it for very short flights for weekend breaks and to be honest that would be pretty desperate. Where to start? They may offer cheaper ""upfront"" costs but add-ons are extortionate. The fact you cannot print off your return boarding pass within 7 days of your return flight is just a way to con people out of the money (£10 per person) to advance purchase a designated seat.

The queuing is still a scrum even though they have finally realised that assigning people seats will stop the kind of behaviour they and their ilk were responsible for creating. On the flight the whole experience is stuffy cramped and bad tempered. The hard-sell starts instantly and continues through the whole flight. The claustrophobic atmosphere is taken further by the fact that some aisles didn't even have windows! They couldn't even be bothered to give out landing cards either which just prolonged the bad experience at the airport. I reckon that after all the add-ons it would have been cheaper to fly with BA.

Ryanair customer review,22/6/2014. Flying from Stansted to Treviso Venice for 7 days holiday we were fine on our outward journey as we had been able to check-in and print off the boarding passes however the system would allow us to do the same for our return at that point in time. Where we were staying we had no access to a computer or printer but assumed perhaps foolishly that at Treviso airport they would have the same system as they do in Stansted and we would be able to check-in and print off at their machines for a nominal fee. How wrong we were. We arrived well before the 2 hour time scale but ended having to pay additional 140 Euros! Money making at its worse I feel very sorry for the staff at the check in desks whilst we were there I saw at least another 2 people who were in the same position as we were. It wasn't until I got home I saw the email from Ryanair advising of the additional costs. I received a text message at 23.00 the night before our departure at 9.50 reminding us we needed to check-in and print off the boarding card if they had notified me in this text of the astronomical charge awaiting us at the airport we would have search around the entire city of Venice for someone to assist us but it wasn't included!

Ryanair customer review,"Like other reviews said the Ryanair website kept crashing so I had to have the ticket agent at the airport print the tickets for me at the ridiculous cost of 15 euros per ticket. During boarding I was told I couldn't bring on my coffee which I had purchased at the cafe right next to the gate (past security) due to ""security concerns"" while everyone else brought on their waters and fruit juices. While on the plane a flight attendant removed my bag from the overhead in order to put in someone else's bag. He then tried to fit mine which contained a laptop Ipad and Kindle into a separate overhead by cramming it in. I finally had to yell at him to stop to which he complained my bag was too large to fit.

Ryanair customer review,Santiago de Compostela to Madrid May 30 2014. I guess we were not the only ones who were ripped off by this airline. We had the same experience as many of the passengers. We reserved online paid with credit card got an email that it's been confirmed. So we were hoping that it will be an easy check in since we came two hours early. We were told at the airport that we should have checked in online and that the payment was forfeited so we had to pay again for the same flight. In addition we had to pay 40 Euros each for our luggage since only 2 small carry ons were allowed. Since we had to go on that flight we had no recourse but to give in.

Ryanair customer review,Flew Manchester-Gran Canaria. Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. In the UK the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return. Overall it may be a budget airline but really not worth the hassle.,fly manchestergran canaria good flight time get baggage quickly attempt print boarding pass scam painful uk site keep crash take good day achieve process repeat holiday destination manchester airport display boarding flight minute continue minute update request proceed boarding explain cattle market leave wait queue good minute consequently flight delay hour explanation apology whilst flight gran canaria seat belt sign light display intermittently long period evidence turbulence explanation adult manage feel passenger young child desperately want toilet baggage allowance kilo hold luggage hand luggage fly manchester count hand luggage allowance return gran canaria decide hold luggage kilo hold luggage weigh exactly manchester hand luggage tell cost euro pay excess have little hand luggage facility available case avoid excess charge admittedly read small print question highlight manchester come light gran canaria return overall budget airline worth hassle,0.0019207671284675598,0.22334307432174683,0.12317349016666412,0.011485841125249863,0.0016363882459700108,0.5462427139282227,0.09219770133495331,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,We travelled twice with Ryanair during the last week. The first trip (Stansted to Pisa) was delayed 45 minutes. Its not so much the delay that's the problem it is the total lack of communication or an apology for the late running. We were asked to queue up for boarding and stood there for over an hour with no communication. Worse was to follow. On the following Saturday we were booked on the 22.00 flight out of Pisa for Stansted. Again no communication or apologies were forthcoming from Ryanair. 150 minutes after the flight should have left we were told it was cancelled - no apology again. We were not offered any refreshment during this three hours. They then booked the passengers a hotel but had only a mini bus to start with to take 16 passengers a time randomly selected by Ryanair staff. We eventually arrived at the hotel at 03.00 but had to be up for an 07.00 departure from the hotel. No food or drinks were offered by Ryanair. No staff were available at Pisa airport to speak to or to hand out vouchers. The service was shabby at best. No apologies poor communication no-one to talk too and no refreshment vouchers either. We will not be travelling with Ryanair again.,travel twice ryanair week trip stanste pisa delay minute delay s problem total lack communication apology late run ask queue boarding stand hour communication bad follow follow saturday book flight pisa stanste communication apology forthcoming ryanair minute flight leave tell cancel apology offer refreshment hour book passenger hotel mini bus start passenger time randomly select ryanair staff eventually arrive hotel departure hotel food drink offer ryanair staff available pisa airport speak hand voucher service shabby good apology poor communication talk refreshment voucher travel ryanair,0.002962757833302021,0.016833465546369553,0.09796848148107529,0.0040170433931052685,0.0025241246912628412,0.8352181315422058,0.04047604650259018,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,We were flying from London-Luton to Dublin on June 1 2014. I am a world traveller and this was the first time an airline charged GBP70 for not printing a boarding pass and we had no choice other than to pay. I and two of my friends ended up missing the flight as it took 5-10 mins to provide the boarding passes - the boarding pass was hand written. We were just running to the gate and airline crew just shut the gate on us (the flight was still open and they refused to take us in). We had to return to the counter hoping that they would transfer us to the next flight: to our shock they demanded another GBP110 per head to transfer.

Ryanair customer review,I've flown a lot over the past decade but have never used Ryanair. The first time was a return trip from London Stansted to Santander in May 2014 (FR2612 / FR2613). Despite worries about Ryanair's reputation it was a very positive experience. The flights including 15 kg of baggage and all extras were very reasonably priced. Both outward and return flights landed a few minutes. Return leg saw us being placed in emergency exit seats rather than our allocated seats which meant extra legroom. Cabin was clean. Seats don't recline but were fine. By following all Ryanair's instructions (printing boarding passes etc.) no extra money had to be paid. Would happily use them again in the future.,ve fly lot past decade ryanair time return trip london stanste santander fr fr despite worry ryanair reputation positive experience flight include kg baggage extra reasonably price outward return flight land minute return leg see place emergency exit seat allocate seat mean extra legroom cabin clean seat not recline fine follow ryanair instruction print boarding pass etc extra money pay happily use future,0.003779367543756962,0.06409700959920883,0.08395080268383026,0.02237231470644474,0.003220007522031665,0.6354432702064514,0.18713721632957458,Topic_6

I made the mistake of not checking in online which I realised was against company policy and by the time I had tried to do this the two hour curfew was on and I couldn't do it. This meant checking in at the airport for the sum of £70 per head (£140 in total) for myself and my wife.

Ryanair customer review,I would not recommend Ryanair. I recently flew from Paris to Barcelona with my wife. We were hoping to save a few dollars by flying this cheap airline. We paid for it. First airport where they fly out of is about 80km from Paris so you will pay extra to get there and it will cost you time. Then when you get there be prepared to pay 10 euros for every kilo overweight (max 20 kilos per checked bag most airlines give 25 kilos per checked bag). Finally don't forget to print your boarding pass because if you don't you will pay 70 euros per person for them to do it at the airport (this was twice as much as the actual ticket). I highly recommend avoiding this airline.

Ryanair customer review,Use of Ryanair is generally a last resort. Flight last Friday from Treviso to Bristol was due to take off at 15:20 but about 30mins beforehand a small storm arrived with torrential rain and lightning meant there was likely to be some delay. However passengers were still gathered around the very small and enclosed gate area as normal and only at departure time was the board updated to show an hour delay. Everyone including several disabled passengers in wheelchairs stayed expecting aircraft arrival and loading as indicated. The storm had passed and other aircraft were moving. No further updates were given and an hour later a further hour delay was updated on the gate display. With no seating for most passengers no refreshments and no information people were becoming unhappy especially as another delayed flight were packed into the same space. When the third hour delay was put up on the display it was accompanied by advice notices for passengers advising of EU travel rights! When the plane eventually arrived just before the third hour of delay and passengers allowed to board the crew were more concerned with making sure we were aware they were due to be off duty soon - no word of any apology for delay from anyone. Part way into the flight back it was then announced the crew was at their limit of allowed flight time and we would be diverted into Brussels for a new crew to board. On landing no crew but another hour wait for them to be roused from homes to take over the flight. Why the operations staff did not allow for this originally is not known! Eventually arrived back in Bristol over four hours late. Needless to say will not be rushing to use Ryanair again anytime soon!,use ryanair generally resort flight friday treviso bristol min small storm arrive torrential rain lightning mean likely delay passenger gather small enclose gate area normal departure time board update hour delay include disabled passenger wheelchairs stay expect aircraft arrival loading indicate storm pass aircraft move update give hour later hour delay update gate display seating passenger refreshment information people unhappy especially delay flight pack space hour delay display accompany advice notice passenger advise eu travel right plane eventually arrive hour delay passenger allow board crew concerned make sure aware duty soon word apology delay way flight announce crew limit allow flight time divert brussels new crew board land crew hour wait rouse home flight operation staff allow originally know eventually arrive bristol hour late needless rush use ryanair anytime soon,0.028368543833494186,0.08155076205730438,0.0739753469824791,0.010779529809951782,0.001541096717119217,0.6836358904838562,0.12014880031347275,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Ryanair's business model appears to me to revolve around cheap ticket pricing with highly complicated and rigid terms and conditions which the majority of people will fall foul of thus allowing Ryanair to introduce additional costs hence restoring their profits.

There were no flights on the same day or the following day from any Milan airport. We had to commute to Milan Malpensa to buy expensive alternate flights to Budapest with an overnight connection at Warsaw. Ryanair is an absolute nightmare of an airline. An utter waste of time and money and the absolute pits in customer service. We will never book it again.

Ryanair customer review,Me and 5 other girls flew Ryanair from Manchester to Tenerife and back again on May 9th 2014. Overall not too bad I guess for a budget airline but the new introduction of the 7 day boarding pass malarkey meant we were stung on the return flight for 70 euros. As this is on the return flight we had obviously spent up and had to contact one of the groups husbands to ask if we cold charge to his credit card to get us home. At no point was this new procedure explained to us (and yes I appreciate it is probably in the very small print but if you are a regular flyer with Ryanair (which the girl who booked was) you would expect something like this to at least be mentioned when you book) and I can in no way begin to fathom how they can justify 70 euros. It is simple case of robbery and Ryanair should be ashamed of themselves.

Ryanair customer review,I don't appreciate their staff service before boarding. In my experience when I was leaving from Birmingham for Barcelona I was requested to put my cabin luggage into the sizer without reminding. Since my luggage which its design is flexible and there are two rows of zippers at that moment it was not suitable for the sizer. I said I can try to make it smaller but there were three staff crowed to me and threatened me they didn't have time to let me organise my items and charge me the penalty immediately. Their attitudes were like robbers and I didn't have any options then because there was nobody beside me. Actually when I returned from Barcelona the same luggage and there were even more items inside but I've used a belt to tie it up. Therefore the length is much less than 20 cm and it perfectly fit the sizer. Due to the delayed flight every passenger was on board without any checking size of their baggage when I left form Barcelona for Birmingham I've also noticed that most of the suitcases were much larger than me but nobody was requested for penalty. I understand terms and conditions of Ryanair in advance. But what a shame the attitude of Ryanair’staff made is unpleasant and 50 pound is not a small fee for me. How come they charged it without any warning (If I could have one more minute to organise my suitcase.) before boarding especially originally I've been tagged the yellow label in the queue however they changed their mind and enforced me when there were no other customers at the boarding gate. I won't recommend anyone to be Ryanair customer and would tell them the story to warn them if they still have to.,not appreciate staff service boarding experience leave birmingham barcelona request cabin luggage sizer remind luggage design flexible row zipper moment suitable sizer say try small staff crow threaten not time let organise item charge penalty immediately attitude like robber not option actually return barcelona luggage item inside ve belt tie length cm perfectly fit sizer delay flight passenger board checking size baggage leave form barcelona birmingham ve notice suitcase large request penalty understand term condition ryanair advance shame attitude ryanairstaff unpleasant pound small fee come charge warning minute organise suitcase board especially originally ve tag yellow label queue change mind enforce customer boarding gate will not recommend ryanair customer tell story warn,0.012261083349585533,0.34347549080848694,0.13448087871074677,0.002995372051373124,0.022264275699853897,0.42002421617507935,0.0644986629486084,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,On its new website it started with a 'contact us' form (carefully buried in the depths of their website). That contact form has now got a very clever gimmick - there's a 'comments' box for freehand input but you cannot use it because you first have to select a 'category of comment/complaint'. The moment you do this the freehand box disappears because they want you to use only their computerised answers.

Ryanair customer review,I will never fly with this airline again until they do way with this ridiculous 7 day check in rule. Yes you can print your out going cards no problem but you cannot now print your return journey if you are on holiday for more than 7 days! Oh sorry you can? If you pay 10 euros a seat extra for allocated seats! Beware folks it does not say anything about this until after have made the original booking.

Ryanair customer review,7 hour delay from Manchester to Palma airport flight FR3441. Checked baggage in and no mention of delay 5 minutes later through security it stated on the flight boards delayed to 00.40 original flight time 17.35. No one at the airport to talk to only a phone at the help desk and then you could not get through. Eventually did speak to someone who did not explain the reason for the delay and explained that food vouchers would be given out at 20.30. Really poor customer service in my opinion. Hiding behind a telephone. Other families with very young children were told that the children under 5 not entitled to food vouchers. Do under 5s not eat and drink?

Ryanair customer review,Although personally I prefer Easyjet and think the service is better everybody on here moaning about various issues / things to do with Ryanair need to realise they're booking a flight on a budget airline which can be priced at 20% of the cost of flying with a national carrier such as BA or KLM or other tour operator airlines such as Monarch Thomas Cook or TUI only if booked at the right time. People moaning about not being able to print boarding passes or check in for more than a week in advance should book reserved seating on the aircraft this allows you to check in and print boarding passes for the following 30 days! Ryanair makes it's profits from various add ons - i.e baggage seat allocation expensive food/drinks. Once all this is added the difference in cost with booking with another airline is still substantial. I am flying to Gran Canaria next week for which I have paid £106.48 return including the added seat allocation reservation. I checked in for both flights on the 17th April. I shall be taking a sandwich onto the flight which will saved me paying £6 for a tasteless one from Ryanair I'll even take a soft drink on board. When booking my flight I had the option to fly Thomas Cook Norwegian Air or Jet2 on the days I wanted to travel - however all 3 were over £300!

Ryanair customer review,On 15th Sept 2013 we four people from Australia after visiting beautiful Paris went to Paris Beauvais airport to catch 9:20 am flight (FR9632) to Rome. All were checked in online the night before in the Hotel we stayed. However boarding passes were not printed out as per instruction in the email from the airline. a mistake was made by us. At the check-in counter we were told EURO 70 per person would be charged if no boarding pass was presented. We could not believe it in the first instance but later were confirmed by his duty manager. We do not believe that EURO 70 for printing a boarding pass is justifiable by any standard. It is in fact more than the airfare itself and more than the fee for an extra luggage (EURO 60). While we accept the error we made the punishment was well beyond anyone's imagination hence it is not reasonable and not justifiable. We felt like being robbed on highway with no way to escape. And we still do. We must point out that the check-in gentleman was kind enough to show us a self-serving Internet kiosk/access point where printing was available. Unfortunately after tried on two computers with loss of a total of EURO 20 worth of coins and notes we went back to the counter and tried to request for printing at a fair and reasonable cost. The second complaint is about the way in which the duty manager a lady handled our request for help. She was arrogant in our view. Having heard of our explanation she showed no sympathy but said it was the company policy and we either pay or do not fly today. The fact that we could not print out the passes at the computer kiosk did not bother her at all because it was someone else's equipment hence nothing to do with her.,th sept people australia visit beautiful paris go paris beauvais airport catch flight fr rome check online night hotel stay boarding pass print instruction email airline mistake checkin counter tell euro person charge boarding pass present believe instance later confirm duty manager believe euro print boarding pass justifiable standard fact airfare fee extra luggage euro accept error punishment anyone imagination reasonable justifiable feel like rob highway way escape point checkin gentleman kind selfserve internet kioskaccess point printing available unfortunately try computer loss total euro worth coin note go counter try request print fair reasonable cost second complaint way duty manager lady handle request help arrogant view have hear explanation show sympathy say company policy pay fly today fact print pass computer kiosk bother else equipment,0.002146701095625758,0.051835402846336365,0.43153199553489685,0.049682408571243286,0.022788969799876213,0.41314271092414856,0.028871793299913406,Topic_3

Ryanair customer review,FR697 from Palma to Prestwick on 16th April 2014. We were not able to check-in online for our return flight to the UK within the 12 days to 2 hours before takeoff window. The website would not accept our booking reference. We assumed we would be able to just print our boarding passes at check-in like any other normal airline. Instead we were told that it didn't matter that we experienced issues online. Ryanair policy states that we now had to pay £70 per head flying regardless of our circumstances otherwise we would be left in Mallorca. This amounted to £210 for my wife daughter and I. The saga did not end there the lady at the Ryanair desk decided it was a good idea to sit a family travelling with a 3 year old completely separately. My daughter - 16F my wife - 17C and me in 16C. We were flying on one of their Boeing 737-800 aircraft and that rows 16 and 17 are exit rows.

Ryanair customer review,Completely agree with D Finnie re: stupid rule of not being able to print boarding cards until 7 days before travel meaning you can't print your return flight boarding cards before leaving home if you are on holiday for 7 days or more. I had no access to internet whilst on holiday (which is the way most people want it as they are on holiday) so unable to print boarding cards and ended up having to pay 210 euros for 3 boarding cards at the airport. Completely ridiculous rule designed to make as much money out of us as possible. All other airlines allow you to print all boarding cards for your entire journey when you check-in online so can't understand why Ryanair don't. It should not be allowed. They lure you in with a cheap flight cost and charge you for everything else. I was really pleased when they announced they would have allocated seating on all flights which is much easier for those of us travelling with children so this should make it even easier to allocate a seat on return flight instead of making us customers with families having to pay at the airport for boarding cards. Ryanair did nothing about this even after I complained to them stating their rules as a legitimate reason and not accepting that the rule is wrong and needs to be changed.,completely agree d finnie stupid rule able print boarding card day travel mean not print return flight boarding card leave home holiday day access internet whilst holiday way people want holiday unable print boarding card end have pay euro boarding card airport completely ridiculous rule design money possible airline allow print boarding card entire journey checkin online not understand ryanair not allow lure cheap flight cost charge pleased announce allocate seating flight easy travel child easy allocate seat return flight instead make customer family have pay airport boarding card ryanair complain state rule legitimate reason accept rule wrong need change,0.0023537634406238794,0.020469296723604202,0.31623634696006775,0.0031910983379930258,0.02453353814780712,0.5833383798599243,0.04987763240933418,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,I have flown with Ryanair many times over the past 6 years and I have just two wishes. Firstly that they would stop being secretive about their latest scam and secondly if they continue to fly to Valencia they consider not changing flight details with such short notice. In March I booked some flights home from Alicante having read in their terms and conditions that they were changing the 14 day check in online to 30 days from April. However nowhere did it mention that they would be charging for the privilege or I most definitely would have booked easyjet who have had the free 30 day check in for sometime. In relation to Valencia flights they have two scheduled flights a week. In the past after disagreement with Valencia they just cancelled the whole route so I was pleased it recommenced even if it was from Manchester. They have now had to push the Monday flight back by half an hour and have given me 3 weeks notice of the change. It now lands at 11pm. Now that doesn't seem like a lot but unfortunately it has quite an impact cost wise as the majority of the car hire firms in Valencia close at 11 and therefore charge you 30-40 euros to open later. Sadly I'll have to now give up on Ryanair just when I think they were really trying hard. I have always followed the rules and never been disappointed with them to be honest you get what you pay for but I'm finally getting to old to try and stay ahead of their next money making change and 7 days check in is ridiculous so it's back to Easyjet.,fly ryanair time past year wish firstly stop secretive late scam secondly continue fly valencia consider change flight detail short notice march book flight home alicante have read term condition change day check online day april mention charge privilege definitely book easyjet free day check relation valencia flight schedule flight week past disagreement valencia cancel route pleased recommence manchester push monday flight half hour give week notice change land pm not like lot unfortunately impact cost wise majority car hire firm valencia close charge euro open later sadly ill ryanair think try hard follow rule disappoint honest pay m finally get old try stay ahead money make change day check ridiculous easyjet,0.025890979915857315,0.049155112355947495,0.33671844005584717,0.0032280252780765295,0.0020283726043999195,0.4650192856788635,0.11795979738235474,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,East Midlands to Tenerife 6th April FR3152. Returned 11th April FR3153. It's great to see that they are finally trying to improve customer service and it was definitely better on the way out. Having allocated seating now is much better although it was not clear when I booked that seats are allocated free at online check in so I unnecessarily paid £40 to do this in advance. Also what on earth is going on with the 'only the first 90 bags' can stay in the cabin idea? Great that you can now take a small bag (handbag laptop bag etc) and put it under your seat. However only the first 90 passengers are allowed to take a correctly sized and weighted wheeled case on board. At Tenerife they decided that everyone had to do this before they got on the plane and it was chaos with people trying to work out what they needed to take out. Strange also that they only pick on wheeled cases even small ones. My partner had a rucksack the contents of which were about the same weight as mine yet my bag was tagged for the hold. By the time I'd taken out all the valuables - camera iPad Kindle etc there was very little left in it. Also there was plenty of empty space on the overhead compartments once we got onboard. All completely pointless. I do think they are trying but they really don't think these things all the way through! All that is going to happen is that people's 2nd bags are gradually going to get larger and larger and there will be the same old rows at check in and the gate as there have always been! Other than that it's pretty good value for money I guess although I agree with other comments about flights times. Lots of them get into Stansted too late for the last trains which prevents me booking with them. Oh and the seats not reclining and no pocket for belongings continues to be tedious. Especially on longer flights.

Ryanair customer review,I fly with Ryanair at least every month. If you compare the flights with travel by coach (which is how they are priced) they are easily as good. One has to stick to the rules and those who try it on with the cabin luggage size and weight allowances deserve all they get in my view. I do feel sorry for those who innocently don't pay enough attention to the very thorough pre flight reminders you always get sent. My flights are about 2.5 hours and that's fine but the seats are a tight fit and do not recline (I am not large but fellow passengers often are) so would not want to be onboard much longer than that. Aircraft's are in good nick and always clean and staff are generally friendly and helpful. Food is edible but only in an emergency! Coffee is fine and sensibly not served too hot. The lottery ticket sales used to grate but as they do fund deserving children's charities it is harsh to moan about that. Reliability on the route I use is excellent as is baggage handling.

No queue at the bag drop desk. Assigned seating is a nice new addition though boarding leaves much to be desired - flight departed 20 minutes late due the slightly slow boarding process which prompted some passengers to buy overpriced priority boarding from Ryanair staff hanging around the gate. Crew on board were professional and what I've noticed is that they smile and are happy to have friendly banter with passengers now - so that's a really added plus since my last trip! Seats not amazingly comfy but ok for the short flight. Arrived in Porto ahead of arrival time and bags were on the belt almost immediately (this is something good that hasn't changed!). I'm impressed by the recent improvements and of course I will consider flying Ryanair again as long as the price is right.,london stanste porto march fr ryanair flight nearly year m happy thing change well queue bag drop desk assign seating nice new addition boarding leave desire flight depart minute late slightly slow boarding process prompt passenger buy overpriced priority boarding ryanair staff hang gate crew board professional ve notice smile happy friendly banter passenger s add plus trip seat amazingly comfy ok short flight arrive porto ahead arrival time bag belt immediately good not change m impressed recent improvement course consider fly ryanair long price right,0.01694074645638466,0.06818217039108276,0.0955323874950409,0.004122501239180565,0.016517814248800278,0.6006578803062439,0.19804656505584717,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Luton to Gran Canaria. I booked it not because it was fairly reasonable price but because it was from a nearby airport. After check-in and gestapo tactics used to extort money for oversized hand baggage my partner spent much of our Holiday stressing about what might happen during the return flight home. Check in even suggested throwing some clothing away to keep the weight down even though the same clothing weight had been ok on the outbound leg. Never again I would happily pay an extra few quid to another airline and be relaxed and enjoy the break. Its surprising just how many folk we chatted with at the Hotel were worried at what tricks might be foisted on them at the Foreign airport relating to hand Baggage.,luton gran canaria book fairly reasonable price nearby airport checkin gestapo tactic extort money oversized hand baggage partner spend holiday stress happen return flight home check suggest throw clothing away weight clothing weight ok outbound leg happily pay extra quid airline relaxed enjoy break surprising folk chat hotel worry trick foist foreign airport relate hand baggage,0.02200726419687271,0.27291935682296753,0.11482516676187515,0.005217559169977903,0.003278806572780013,0.40738868713378906,0.1743631809949875,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Flew Ryanair for the first time 2 weeks ago and again last week. Derry to Birmingham and back. Having read the reviews it was with some trepidation I booked the flights as they are the only airline flying to Derry it was forced on me. The web site wasn't too difficult and I was prompted by online live chat if I dallied they were helpful and reassured me only one booking had been made. Paid for hold luggage as I had a laptop bag as well. Reserved seats were welcome. I printed the boarding passes off before hand and arrived in plenty of time. Onboard reasonable bit garish and the selling wasn't too obnoxious given only a 50 min flight. Depart and arrive on time. So overall the experience wasn't too bad but then everything worked ok. The nagging feeling is what if it hadn't? But given the price you get what you pay for. Would I fly with them again? Given it was the only airline to that airport then yes. If to another airport and there was an alternative and there were consequences to not arriving on time and the company was paying then I would think very hard about it.,fly ryanair time week ago week derry birmingham have read review trepidation book flight airline fly derry force web site not difficult prompt online live chat dally helpful reassure booking pay hold luggage laptop bag reserve seat welcome print boarding pass hand arrive plenty time onboard reasonable bit garish selling not obnoxious give min flight depart arrive time overall experience not bad work ok nagging feeling not give price pay fly give airline airport yes airport alternative consequence arrive time company pay think hard,0.002958729164674878,0.06865299493074417,0.1535026729106903,0.1328279674053192,0.030015844851732254,0.48412787914276123,0.12791386246681213,Topic_6

You can still check in up to 15 days before the flight without having to pay for an allocated seat despite what they say.

Ryanair customer review,Feb 14 MAN-Paphos. This is the most budget airline I have come across I became paranoid about the weight of my luggage! Thankfully we were within the guidelines however on arrival to the gate (2 Ryanair) employees were waiting to pounce scrutinising everyone's hand luggage and asking them to place their cabin bags in the frame. Lucky for us we were OK but numerous passengers who 'could not fit' theirs were made to pay £50 which were then put in the hold. Why did the check in staff not ask to weigh their cabin bags at check in - in my opinion this is the way they make an extra £50 per passenger - some cheap flight for these unfortunate people (students) many of whom were going home for half term and short of money to begin with - for me never again.

Ryanair customer review,Booked my first (and last) Ryanair flight from Edinburgh to Dublin because it was a great price: £15 each way! But as I heard from everyone they always try to get you with fees. I wasn't able to check in online beforehand so I tried to explain my problem when I got to the airport two hours before the flight. They told me I couldn't fly unless I paid £70 to print off my boarding pass. There's no way I'm paying £70 for a £15 ticket. No other airline has such ridiculous charges.

Fantastic prices to and from Tenerife great service onboard.

Ryanair customer review,After years of refusing to use Ryanair due to time/date constraints I had to book a flight with them today. I've also heard and did notice that they've removed ridiculous charges (for paying on line etc). However I've just noticed that I can only check in online 7 days before the flights unless I buy a pre-allocated seat. Because of my flight times this means I will have to find a place to print out my boarding pass while away. So yes it's an improvement that people can pre book seats but they have reduced the online check in time from 15 days to 7 if you don't pre book and pay for the seats.

Ryanair customer review,Have flown MAN - DUB - MAN/LBA bi-monthly with Ryanair and have been very impressed every single time. First of all a flight 2 weeks in advance from the booking date for £9.99 one way can not be denied this is a brilliant price for an on-time flight on a virtually brand new 737-800. The one gripe I'd have is the allocated seating (something that most airlines use effectively). As a frequent FR traveller I pick the same seat every time unfortunately the common sense of booking and then finding your seat seems to have evaded some people as it turned into some chaos - so I'd advise to still get on the aircraft towards the front. Other than that I'm extremely happy to fly Ryanair again and again as the on-time no-frills cheap flights will always be too good to turn down!

Ryanair customer review,First experience of Ryanair's new self proclaimed 'industry leading customer service'. Stansted to Tampere out 31st Jan return 3rd Feb. The allocated seating (on the return leg) was a big improvement. The seats are still bolt upright but at 6ft 3 I've never found the legroom to be that bad. This leaves us with the migrane inducing yellow the bright cabin lights and the constant procession of scratchcard sales and frankly annoying announcements about the still overpriced microwave food to moan about. They seem to have at least stopped the irritating soft drink adverts on replay. I guess Ryanair are an option if they are flying where you want to actually go but my own conclusion - as a relatively frequent flyer - is that there is no point in saving a little bit of money if it costs you a lot of time and hassle which on this trip it still did.,experience ryanair new self proclaim industry lead customer service stanste tampere st jan return rd feb allocate seating return leg big improvement seat bolt upright ft ve find legroom bad leave migrane induce yellow bright cabin light constant procession scratchcard sale frankly annoying announcement overprice microwave food moan stop irritate soft drink advert replay guess ryanair option fly want actually conclusion relatively frequent flyer point save little bit money cost lot time hassle trip,0.06330907344818115,0.04365897178649902,0.09062987565994263,0.01827947609126568,0.0025349289644509554,0.5093469619750977,0.27224066853523254,Topic_6

Eventually after another 10 mins another clerk opened desk 20 and we moved over there. No priority check in just free for all.

On board is a joke leg room and general scope of the seating is ridiculous. All cabin crew were rude and only wanted to sell things. We heard about the seat belt signs coming on for turbulence just before the trolleys come out and sure enough this happened twice on the way out and back apparently an old Ryanair trick. Return check in at Tenerife was ridiculous 5 Ryanair flights being checked in at one time through 3 desks that's nearly 700 passengers. No Ryanair staff on duty and no one is interested in what you have to say. Usual stampede for seats together again why should we pay for that privilege? Its standard with everyone else.

Ryanair customer review,FR555/552 Manchester-Dublin 30/12/13-02/01/14. I fly quite a few times a year but this was my first time with Ryanair so I was interested to compare. I have to say if you follow the rules that are made very clear to you well before departure you will have no problems. There were a few people who hadn't printed boarding passes or their cases were far too big for the cabin and they were moaning about being charged to check them in etc. Yes the fees for printing are totally ridiculous for printing a sheet of paper but just don't get yourself in that situation! I had booked an exit row seat for an extra £10 which included priority boarding. I have to say it was worth it especially being tall. I arrived at the gate 45 minutes before the departure time to see a huge queue waiting for the boarding to start. The priority boarding queue was empty so I walked straight down and waited for around 15 minutes. Then a member of staff came over and said would you like to come forward we are ready after my pass was checked the barrier for the others was opened. I boarded the plane first after a few minutes wait at the bottom of the stairs of the plane and got settled whilst everyone else boarded. I'm not sure if this system works if there is a bus to catch to the plane? One benefit of being nearer to the front of the queue is getting seats with family/friends and having space to store luggage as many people we struggling to find places for their luggage once the plane was filling up. The flight was comfortable and crew were fairly friendly but seemed in a rush to serve drinks and were quite sharp with a few customers who were asking for a drink of water. The people in front were drinking their own alcohol and were sharply told that they couldn't consume their own alcohol on board. Overall I found the experience far better than expected even though the service of other airlines isn't present but the price was far far lower! I would fly Ryanair again especially as their flights seem to have few delays and they are bringing in allocated seating.,fr manchesterdublin fly time year time ryanair interested compare follow rule clear departure problem people not print boarding pass case far big cabin moan charge check etc yes fee printing totally ridiculous print sheet paper not situation book exit row seat extra include priority boarding worth especially tall arrive gate minute departure time huge queue wait boarding start priority boarding queue walk straight wait minute member staff come say like come forward ready pass check barrier open board plane minute wait stair plane get settle whilst board m sure system work bus catch plane benefit near queue get seat familyfriend have space store luggage people struggle find place luggage plane fill flight comfortable crew fairly friendly rush serve drink sharp customer ask drink water people drink alcohol sharply tell not consume alcohol board overall find experience far well expect service airline not present price far far lower fly ryanair especially flight delay bring allocate seating,0.008807012811303139,0.033050380647182465,0.10946865379810333,0.025036782026290894,0.0013448108220472932,0.7148414850234985,0.1074509397149086,Topic_6

I was told to sit and wait until I get a call. At 9.00 pm I went and asked again and I was told to wait 5 minutes later a lady came to me and asked if I was flying to Faro ans was told to follow her.

Ryanair customer review,"Travel monthly Liverpool to Dublin the most recent the flight from Liverpool could not land due to storm force winds. The 3.20pm flight eventually left at 10.20pm - 5 euro refreshment voucher. We queued for the flight at 7.05pm but that was cancelled for technical reasons. Passengers were offered transfers to flights to Manchester or Birmingham or the 10.20pm flight. I suppose not their fault but instead of asking passengers who wanted to go to Manchester to go to one desk and the others at another desk I was told ""first come first served"". Strange thing was the late flight could cater for all the passengers who were going to Liverpool so the technical fault saved them a flight to Liverpool. The 10.20pm flight was a nightmare with about twenty males all drunk and swearing and having to be advised by cabin staff to behave to be fair there was no alcohol sold on the flight. I will continue to use Ryanair as they are cheap but when possible travel on early morning flights you miss the stag/hen/football fans.

Ryanair customer review,My girlfriend and I arrived early and were treated to a lengthy queue at Stansted before a manic rush for seats ensued. Does the company not realise that not allocating seats will cause this? It flares up tempers and causes the whole plane load of passengers to be angry from the start. I stored my hand luggage in the overhead compartment and when I eventually got (semi) comfortable in my tiny seat I was asked by the cabin crew to move my bag from the overhead compartment to under my seat. I am 6.5ft tall and I explained this to the cabin crew that I would not have any room for my legs if I did this. Both the outgoing and return journeys were the same with absolutely no comfort whatsoever and incessant adverts being played to us offering to sell e-cigs or take part in exciting competitions. Any food on offer was overpriced. The return flight from Venice (the out of town airport) was akin to my Army days in Northern Ireland. Normally reasonable people cooped up like battery hens in a hot and stuffy room forced to stand for 2 hours waiting for Ryanair to sort their act out. After 2 hours the queue system we have ourselves put in place started to crumble and people began to flare up. Once the doors opened it was literally a stampede. Dozens of angry sweaty people paying for the privilege of running a race. I was exhausted by the experience.

Ryanair customer review,Vilnius to Leeds/Bradford Oct 18th. My complaint is about the airport departure experience. Being a party of 5 with a baby we paid for priority boarding. What this meant in practice was that we had the pleasure (!) of standing at the head of a queue for about 75 minutes. The flight was about 30 mins late arriving and departing which must have been known by the departure gate staff yet they made no attempt deal with the queue that formed either by telling people to go and sit down while waiting or delaying checking people through the gate. I have written to Ryanair but am awaiting a response as I write. I can't rubbish them completely as the flight was relatively comfortable and onboard staff were quite pleasant.

Ryanair customer review,I have just flown from Dublin to Manchester. It was my first time flying with Ryanair and I really wasn't looking forward to the flight as I have heard many extremely bad reviews. The flight in all honestly was not a bad flight we arrived 15 minutes early into Manchester and I have no complaints regarding the crew on board they were pleasant and polite. This company have a terrible reputation for trying to get money any which way they can however if you read the terms and conditions properly there should be no reason for you to part with your hard earned cash. The seat pitch was fine for me a female at 5ft 4 inches and for the 45 minute duration but I can imagine it must be extremely uncomfortable for men as I can imagine if you tall it would be awful for those longer flights. One thing which I really didn't like was the non-existent seat allocation. I felt as if I was part of a cattle herd trying to get on board as people had started to queue an hour before we were due to depart to ensure families got seats together. Ryanair overall is not terrible you get what you pay for. They are a budget no frills airline and I think people tend to forget about that.

On arriving at check-in we were told that we should have a printed ticket. Naturally being travelers we didn't have a printed ticket. We were told it would cost 20 pounds extra each to get a printed ticket. The flight from Edinburgh to Barcelona was amazing with drunken young females swearing badly. I think the Rynair flight from Turnhouse to Girona (about 70 km from Barcelona) was probably the biggest con we have ever had in 20 years of travelling around the world. I can't really remember but I think the original price on the internet was something like 47 pounds each. They added on a percentage because we booked with a credit card. They naturally added extra for baggage. We knew about this charge but of course Rynair have already worked out that international travellers are allowed 25 kilos but they only allow 15 kilos before excess baggage charges kick in. We were so upset about our treatment from Ryanair and the check-in experience that there is no way we would use that company again.,scot live oz book online edinburgh receive ticket email ryanair know tourist carry printer arrive checkin tell printed ticket naturally traveler not print ticket tell cost pound extra printed ticket flight edinburgh barcelona amazing drunken young female swear badly think rynair flight turnhouse girona km barcelona probably big con year travel world not remember think original price internet like pound add percentage book credit card naturally add extra baggage know charge course rynair work international traveller allow kilo allow kilo excess baggage charge kick upset treatment ryanair checkin experience way use company,0.015545745380222797,0.16860662400722504,0.438009113073349,0.016553742811083794,0.015199867077171803,0.27866795659065247,0.06741694360971451,Topic_3
Ryanair customer review,We flew from Manchester to Barcelona on 19th October and returned on 26th. The plane was punctual clean and functional and you get what you pay for. I would advise anyone to pack some sandwiches for each journey and to buy a drink once you have checked in. Boots at Manchester is cheapest for water.

Ryanair customer review,Recently I travelled to Barcelona with British Airways. Have used Ryanair on a number of occasions so I was interested to compare the two. Can't wait to get back to Ryanair. On British Airways the food was rubbish the seat were uncomfortable and cramped and the staff were uninterested in no one but the first class passengers. At least I know when I fly with Ryanair the plane will be new and clean and the seats are comfortable. The food is acceptable and worth the money. They are nearly always on time.

Ryanair customer review,"I have never been spoken to so rudely or treated with such contempt. I understood I should check in online but as I had problems printing this I was lead to understand that all details would be held by Ryanair and this would be fine. The staff were rude and unhelpful.

My partner and myself both have eye problems and when I again requested some assistance I was very curtly told ""just put your glasses on"".

Ryanair customer review,Flew from Stansted to Lanzarote with my partner. The outward journey was fine. It was the return where the problems started. I had to pay £50 each way for my guitar to come away with me. On my outward journey they let me take the guitar on the Plane with no problems. On the return journey at the check in desk the staff asked if I wanted to put the guitar in the hold. I said no as its a valuable instrument. So they let me take it through. They did not inform me that I couldn't take it on the plane. As I was about to board a staff member told me that I couldn't take it on the plane and that it would have to go in the hold. Wasn't happy about that but there was no other option. She then charged me 60 Euro's for this even though I had already paid 50 to bring the guitar and the instrument was listed on my boarding pass. They didn't tell me at check in that it had to go in the hold and that I couldn't take it on the plane. So they either purposely tried to rip me off or the girl at the check in desk didn't know what she was on about therefore I had to pay for her mistake.,fly stansted lanzarote partner outward journey fine return problem start pay way guitar come away outward journey let guitar plane problem return journey check desk staff ask want guitar hold say valuable instrument let inform not plane board staff member tell not plane hold not happy option charge euro pay bring guitar instrument list boarding pass not tell check hold not plane purposely try rip girl check desk not know pay mistake,0.003040397772565484,0.10711114853620529,0.2795460820198059,0.08782267570495605,0.002590435091406107,0.475044846534729,0.044844429939985275,Topic_6

We had to pay £140 to have 2 sheets of paper printed by the rudest person you could meet. Coming home we paid £14 for a Gin and Tonic and a hot chocolate drink! We had the most uncomfortable journey back to Stansted. We were unable to land at Stansted due to severe storms and were diverted to Birmingham. We sat on the plane at Birmingham for 2 hours while the Captain decided whether or not to fly back to Stansted. In the end he said we all had to leave the plane and coaches would be laid on to take us to Stansted. He had no idea when the coaches would arrive but said it would be hours not minutes.

Ryanair customer review,London Luton to Knock Mayo West of Ireland yesterday 16/10/13 on the 11.50am flight. I checked online before leaving and no reported delays. I also checked on the screen upon entering the airport at approx. 10.15am and again no reported delays (only information was flight information and check-in desk to go to). Then after going through quite a security queue I'd been informed by another passenger that the flight had been delayed until 3pm which was confirmed on the displays. The scheduled time then varied from approx. 2.45 to 4pm changing quite regularly. So after a considerable time spent waiting at the airport the flight finally took off well after 3.15pm (by this time I was sitting on the plane and too tired to note the time of takeoff). I would recommend implementing a free beverage/drink for all customers in cases where any flight is more than 2 (or 2.5hrs) late. As this would show an acknowledgement the apology by the company and would not cost the company very much in terms of stock. In fact I'd say customers might then opt for seconds for which Ryanair could charge resulting in profitable sales overall. In addition no information was passed onto the customers as to the reason for this delay.,london luton knock mayo west ireland yesterday flight check online leave report delay check screen enter airport approx report delay information flight information checkin desk go security queue d inform passenger flight delay pm confirm display schedule time vary approx pm change regularly considerable time spend wait airport flight finally take pm time sit plane tired note time takeoff recommend implement free beveragedrink customer case flight hrs late acknowledgement apology company cost company term stock fact d customer opt second ryanair charge result profitable sale overall addition information pass customer reason delay,0.0028111543506383896,0.05652495101094246,0.2578077018260956,0.0038116788491606712,0.015977768227458,0.5751287341117859,0.08793805539608002,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Dublin to Ibiza 8 Oct and return 15 Oct 13. First time using Ryanair booked via an online holiday site and wasn't aware on booking that it was Ryanair. We had printed off our boarding passes and booked in hold luggage with smaller bags for hand luggage which fitted under our seats as due to the ridiculous size of hand luggage now allowed by most airlines have had problems in the past finding space above so I don't think it is worth the hassle this is by no means exclusive to Ryanair. Flight was good on time purchased only coffee at 3 euro don't think that is extortionate to pay. My complaints would be: 1) never having flew Ryanair I wasn't aware that it was unallocated seating and this caused a stampede for the seats. 2) due to the quick turnaround the plane was not cleaned between flights and the floor at my seat was covered in used tissue. From Dublin priority boarding did get on first but coming back in Ibiza everyone put onto a bus at the same time priority boarding let off a few minutes earlier but hadn't completed boarding when the next lot got off so I don't think I would pay for PB if flying with them in the future.

Ryanair customer review,Although the vast majority of Ryanair staff we encountered on our flight from Bournemouth Airport were helpful and polite the first woman we encountered on check-in was utterly obnoxious. We had arrived 11 minutes before check- in was to close and no other passengers were queuing except ourselves yet the woman did not meet us with a professional greeting of good morning but barked at us 'You have one minute to process your baggage' and as my husband's suitcase was over the weight limit was unhelpful in resolving the situation and refused to allow us to pay a fine there but only when we had removed the offending items and struggled with them to the departure gate. My husband and I were stunned by this aggressive attitude and absolute lack of professionalism. The struggle to find available seats once we boarded was chaotic and with many crying children was a stressful experience.

So on return to UK I complained and requested that the priority boarding fee was refunded. Rather than customer service I received a curt ""we do not make refunds"".

Ryanair customer review,Never again! Our two year old was expected to sit over 7 aisles away from any of the adults in our party. Due to boarding staff the queue at the gate was disrupted this resulted in our party being placed further along the queue to board (we had been near the front). When we finally got on board there were only odd seats dotted around the aircraft. None of the adults could be seated together which was not such a major issue but the Ryanair flight attendants (there for safety not service) thought it perfectly ok to seat a two year old 7 aisles from the nearest adult in our party. A two year old cannot understand or comprehend any safety procedure and Ryanair do not even accept unaccompanied minors.,year old expect sit aisle away adult party boarding staff queue gate disrupt result party place queue board near finally get board odd seat dot aircraft adult seat major issue ryanair flight attendant safety service think perfectly ok seat year old aisle near adult party year old understand comprehend safety procedure ryanair accept unaccompanied minor,0.07019704580307007,0.04238522797822952,0.05067552253603935,0.025836020708084106,0.024388916790485382,0.7028718590736389,0.08364543318748474,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Flown numerous times with Ryanair. Liverpool to Reus. Always the cheapest. With Ryanair all you have to do is follow some very basic rules and you wont have any trouble at all. Make sure you have booked in any hold luggage on line its much cheaper but you can take 10kg each as hand luggage6 of us so spreading it round saves you a lot of money. Also it amazes me when people cry when they have to pay the £60 if they haven't printed their boarding cards before hand. Why not? I do not have a printer so just pop down to a local library to print them out. Yes Ryanair is a bit like catching a bus and you just sit where there is space but so what flight times are not long haul and I'm sure you can put up with it for a few hours. There is a lot of selling during the flight but again so what. Don't buy anything if you don't want to. Food is a rip off agreed so I have never purchased anything.

Ryanair customer review,24/9 and 1/10 Manchester - Faro. Perhaps I am too fussy as I normally fly scheduled for business and this was the first time I used Ryanair. I weighed my case at 14kg but Ryanair insisted it was 17kg. I was told to take things out and put them in my golf bag. If you forget the boarding pass that is printed by yourself there is a penalty of££70! The crew on both legs were surly. All they did on a 2.5 hour flight was to try and sell things. Boarding is a joke with everyone squeezing 10kg in lockers which do not have the capacity. As I said I normally fly schedule and they appear a similar price for far superior service.

Ryanair customer review,I flew from Stansted to Vasteras on 3rd October with a group (8 people 4 underage/children). Initially our bags were too large to fit through the allowance restrictions they had set so after shuffling the baggage a little they fit perfectly. The staff however showed no respect and little empathy with the situation of a mother carrying baby essentials in her purse. Of course we did not expect this to be the case but some nice treatment would have been much preferred to the screaming we endured about how the airline punctuality would be abused if we did not pay a fine. Before reshuffling the items in our bags the staff insisted that we pay the fine and requested that some of us be through to the plane. The children passed through (passport checked) and waited for the others only to have the staff lock the door on them separating them from parents simply to threaten our group that punctuality is crucial (even though we were boarding ahead of schedule). Unfortunately a handbag was taken (not disposed of but taken) and we made it to our seats. It seems that the staff of the airline are also not fond of people placing baggage in overhead compartments while safety demonstration is on as they requested to be seated and silent until takeoff. The irony in the situation! After that flight it's safe to say that Ryanair has lost 8 potential customers and maybe even more considering the other customers who had to endure the rude woman at the boarding gate.,fly stanste vastera rd october group people underagechildren initially bag large fit allowance restriction set shuffle baggage little fit perfectly staff show respect little empathy situation mother carry baby essential purse course expect case nice treatment preferred screaming endure airline punctuality abuse pay fine reshuffle item bag staff insist pay fine request plane child pass passport check wait staff lock door separate parent simply threaten group punctuality crucial board ahead schedule unfortunately handbag take dispose take seat staff airline fond people place baggage overhead compartment safety demonstration request seat silent takeoff irony situation flight safe ryanair lose potential customer maybe consider customer endure rude woman boarding gate,0.011448798701167107,0.2179255336523056,0.03537002205848694,0.0027477454859763384,0.0017266373615711927,0.654476523399353,0.07630477100610733,Topic_6

Hot food ran out and staff did not seem to have any comments other than what were likely to have been stock responses it seems if your flight is later in the day it is 'pot luck' if the advertised food is available as it is not replenished between stops!

Ryanair customer review,I was catching the morning flight from Barcelona to Rome with 3 other companions. We sat awaiting to board when the call came up. We watched the farce play out as passenger after passenger wrestled with their carry on to shove it into the small regulation box. If they couldn't get it in the little metal box they got fined. As the line finally whittled down we decided to board. They don't turn on the air-conditioning until the plane is in the air. It was then we realised that the seats were not allocated first come first serve. We had to hold our carry on on our laps. I looked above me wondering why we couldn't put our carry on in the overhead compartments. Finally the aircon came on - just about the same time the captain started advertising the sale of scratchcards.,catch morning flight barcelona rome companion sit await board come watch farce play passenger passenger wrestle carry shove small regulation box not little metal box get fine line finally whittle decide board not turn airconditioning plane air realise seat allocate come serve hold carry lap look wonder not carry overhead compartment finally aircon come time captain start advertise sale scratchcard,0.020930876955389977,0.2522398829460144,0.05351048707962036,0.02221796289086342,0.0204311553388834,0.5450568795204163,0.08561278879642487,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Beauvais (Paris) to Bratislava 8 September: the absence of any seat booking as a standard service makes boarding Ryanair feel like a cattle yard experience (we paid the extra for a seat reservation and that worked well). The total inflexibility on luggage weight is a sham and price gouge policy. We are both smallish people our carry on luggage was well under weight and one checked in bag (which of course we paid for) was 1 kg over bang another 20E ie it is per bag if hers was under and mine over you still pay on the one that is over. The flight crew were fine but the check in woman forgot to stamp my wife's boarding document so having gone through the queue we had to run back for that. The airport shuttle service from Porte Maillot to Beauvais was very good but it is 1.5 hrs. Ryanair is now my airline of last resort.,beauvais paris bratislava september absence seat booking standard service make boarding ryanair feel like cattle yard experience pay extra seat reservation work total inflexibility luggage weight sham price gouge policy smallish people carry luggage weight check bag course pay kg bang e ie bag pay flight crew fine check woman forget stamp wife boarding document have go queue run airport shuttle service porte maillot beauvais good hrs ryanair airline resort,0.019829628989100456,0.31806060671806335,0.16357865929603577,0.004717990756034851,0.0029648770578205585,0.4016488790512085,0.08919938653707504,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Flown this week from Oporto to Barcelona and back. Being a first-time flyer I certainly don't have the experience to compare it with other airlines but I must say I don't get what all the fuss is about. Everyone seems to hate Ryanair and I had a very pleasant experience with them. No troubles with luggage we weren't even asked to measure it or weight it at boarding though I understand that was a stroke of luck. Staff were very polite and nice the only rudeness I witnessed were from the passengers themselves mainly some who had the luck of boarding with clearly oversized bags and then were surprised when they didn't fit in the compartments. Seats were comfortable they are no tighter that the average bus/train seat I was expecting much worse from all the reviews I read. Flights arrived earlier than the quoted time. They do play a lot of ads during the flight for their services but you aren't forced to buy anything and the staff doesn't get all in your face with it. All in all a very pleasant flight. I could have never afforded the trip if it wasn't for Ryanair. Just don't go to one of their flights with your mind set on trying to beat their system. If you want it cheap then you must abide by their rules. If you don't want to be bothered with that just go with the pricier airlines.,fly week oporto barcelona firsttime flyer certainly not experience compare airline not fuss hate ryanair pleasant experience trouble luggage not ask measure weight boarding understand stroke luck staff polite nice rudeness witness passenger mainly luck boarding clearly oversized bag surprised not fit compartment seat comfortable tight average bustrain seat expect bad review read flight arrive early quote time play lot ad flight service not force buy staff not face pleasant flight afford trip not ryanair not flight mind set try beat system want cheap abide rule not want bother pricier airline,0.01518640760332346,0.15060926973819733,0.07435469329357147,0.02931414544582367,0.00232797977514565,0.5019214749336243,0.22628605365753174,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,London Stansted to Seville and return 18-26th Sep. It seems that to supplement the apparent cheap fares they look for any and every excuse under the sun to get money out of you. We did not have the ability during our trip to remote Spain to pre-print the boarding passes thought this would not be a problem as we had flown with a world class budget airline Air Asia earlier in the year and they provide machines at the airports to check in or you could use you smart phone to display the barcode. Ryanair charged us 140 Euros for two boarding passes which took the girl at check-in 30 seconds to do. This was as much as the return fares from Stansted to Seville. Surely a charge must reflect the effort or cost associated with providing the service. They then bombard you before and during the flight trying to make you buy more rubbish from them.,london stanste seville return th sep supplement apparent cheap fare look excuse sun money ability trip remote spain preprint boarding pass think problem fly world class budget airline air asia early year provide machine airport check use smart phone display barcode ryanair charge euro boarding pass take girl checkin second return fare stanste seville surely charge reflect effort cost associate provide service bombard flight try buy rubbish,0.003718271618708968,0.125320702791214,0.2730042338371277,0.022500846534967422,0.020848868414759636,0.4479883313179016,0.10661876946687698,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Having flown Ryanair before I thought I knew what sort of flight to expect sadly this airline has gone from bad to awful. I boarded with my hand luggage having been meticulously measured and weighted by staff at the gate to find a free for all frenzy aboard. The over head luggage lockers were already full with many people still clutching bags in the aisle. Eventually after finding a vacant seat I asked the attendant where I should place my bag. I was told to put it under the seat in front of me I tried it didn't fit the attendant tried it still didn't fit so I was told to put it in the space between the seats. I questioned where I would then put my legs to be told that I would have to squeeze them in on top of my case. I said that this was unacceptable for a 2.5hr flight to be told that it was by own fault for not booking priority boarding and that my luggage would be off loaded if I did not comply! I refused pointing out my bag was within the correct size only after some adjacent passengers chipped in did the steward seek to put my bag elsewhere. On the way back the flight was not fully booked so staff sectioned off a few rows of seats just to make sure no one enjoyed any extra space they had not paid for - talk about no frills this is a whole new level.,have fly ryanair think know sort flight expect sadly airline go bad awful board hand luggage have meticulously measure weight staff gate find free frenzy aboard head luggage locker people clutch bag aisle eventually find vacant seat ask attendant place bag tell seat try not fit attendant try not fit tell space seat question leg tell squeeze case say unacceptable hr flight tell fault book priority boarding luggage load comply refuse point bag correct size adjacent passenger chip steward seek bag way flight fully book staff section row seat sure enjoy extra space pay talk frill new level,0.038003116846084595,0.2509249150753021,0.09640420228242874,0.03692275285720825,0.024287858977913857,0.4526132345199585,0.1008438915014267,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,We booked with Ryanair due to the reasonable flight take off times printed off the boarding passes at the local library I don't own a printer. The airline offered me the choice of pre-booking a seat as there weren't many left to choose from going by the list of available seat's. Once we got on board only 4 rows were reserved and were told just find a seat after row 5 they are all free. As for coming back from Spain this week all of the Spanish people were pulled out of the long queue and moved to the front. Is it just English people who hate queuing. My girlfriend purchased a wooden gift which weighed no more than 2 pounds and 4 inches wide but it was 5 inches taller than the allowed case height. She had no hand luggage so thought it would be reasonable to take it on board. No it was classed as oversized and the woman in charge having no common sense wanted to charge us the sum of 60 Euro to stick a label on it. Once on board we found several seats still empty. Surely knowing this a bit of lenience would have been used. Where once on board the seat next to us was empty anyway so she had to leave it at the boarding gate.

Would it not be sensible for a warning to come up to notify passengers of this requirement when booking the ticket instead of someone arriving at the airport and being refused boarding! It was the attitude of the girl on the check in desk that was incredulous she was unsympathetic and very rude. Customer care/service obviously not part of her training.,have travel recently ryanair stanste dublin avoid travel check online reserve seat party noneu passport direct boarding pass go passport check desk tell not fly ireland not visa sensible warning come notify passenger requirement book ticket instead arrive airport refuse boarding attitude girl check desk incredulous unsympathetic rude customer careservice obviously training,0.004484050907194614,0.2617742717266083,0.1947897970676422,0.006079811602830887,0.027219682931900024,0.449739933013916,0.05591244995594025,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,We went to Spain from 8th-16th when we booked we had to fork out £50 for 1 suitcase so we had to share! This was the first time I have been with Ryanair and I wont be returning. We didn't have a clue that you had to rush to find a seat on the plane. Once on the flight we had to sit in seats that hadn't been cleaned. On the return we arrived with 1 suitcase and me with 1 hand luggage our suitcase had jumped up to 21kg so it was either pay or throw something out. In the end a towel and a pair of shoes got chucked and we ended up with only 19kg. We bought duty free turns out it takes 1 hour to get through your gate due to the fact you have to fit all duty free in your hand luggage and your hand luggage has to be 10kg or under!

Ryanair customer review,"My husband and I were on a 14 day holiday and selected Ryanair to fly from Edinburgh to Dublin on September 15. I purchased tickets on August 23. In the US it customary for passengers to print their airline tickets at kiosk by simply entering their confirmation number of their itinerary. When I attempted to do the same the kiosk requested payment of 140 pounds. My husband and I were completely stunned as we had already made payment to Ryanair for the tickets which included priority boarding and baggage fees. When I questioned the employee I was informed that I would have to pay 140 pounds in order to board the flight! We felt completely extorted by Ryanair's unscrupulous fees. After paying this fee we were then told that we could bring on 1 carry on bag-this would include a ladies handbag. We were instructed to place our carry on in this ridiculous contraption. If the bag exceeded this Ryanair informed us that we had to pay an additional 60 pounds. I seriously caution anyone to seek alternative air transportation when considering Ryanair as their mode of transportation as it will considerably be cheaper than using the so called ""low fare"" airline.",husband day holiday select ryanair fly edinburgh dublin september purchase ticket august customary passenger print airline ticket kiosk simply enter confirmation number itinerary attempt kiosk request payment pound husband completely stunned payment ryanair ticket include priority boarding baggage fee question employee inform pay pound order board flight feel completely extort ryanair unscrupulous fee pay fee tell bring carry bagthis include lady handbag instruct place carry ridiculous contraption bag exceed ryanair inform pay additional pound seriously caution seek alternative air transportation consider ryanair mode transportation considerably cheap call low fare airline,0.08155102282762527,0.20833338797092438,0.24975381791591644,0.05890234187245369,0.029237175360322,0.3439764976501465,0.028245776891708374,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,I cannot understand why Ryanair allows each passenger to take a carry on bag on board if there is only space for half of them in the overhead locker. The flight attendant stuffed my bag under the seat in front of me and I was very uncomfortable. I chose a nice looking brown bread sandwich from the booklet and of course it was not available. I have to say though that the flight attendants on this flight Paphos - Thessaloniki on 12 Sep 2013 were very friendly. On the way back on Sep 16 2013 the flight was delayed and we finally boarded at 11.00 pm and of course by then I had learned my lesson and ran to the plane to get a space in the overhead locker. The female flight attendant was obviously very tired and huffed and puffed all the way to Paphos If was very visible that she hated her job and all the pax on board. The male flight attendant drank from a water bottle closed the toilet door with his foot and counted the money at the end of the service in the front where all passengers could see.,understand ryanair allow passenger carry bag board space half overhead locker flight attendant stuff bag seat uncomfortable choose nice look brown bread sandwich booklet course available flight attendant flight paphos thessaloniki sep friendly way sep flight delay finally board pm course learn lesson run plane space overhead locker female flight attendant obviously tired huffed puff way paphos visible hate job pax board male flight attendant drink water bottle close toilet door foot count money end service passenger,0.0030419023241847754,0.11269110441207886,0.07350245863199234,0.11248067021369934,0.016684699803590775,0.559633195400238,0.1219659298658371,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,First time user of Ryanair so to be on the safe side booked seats and got priority boarding. We were very surprised at how smoothly everything went. Coming back from Palma it was obvious the people in front of us had used Ryanair before. They were a couple with two children and had put a large bag on the floor with coats on top and got the youngest child to lay on it. The father had another large bag over his shoulder. The Ryanair staff were walking down the line as we were waiting to board with a box the size of what suitcases were allowed a shand luggage but I never saw them check against anybody's luggage. Some of the so called hand luggage was almost as big as my hold suitcase. After we all boarded a young couple squashed into the extra legroom pretending to let people pass by then were amazed that there was no seats left together so they ended up sitting there.

Ryanair customer review,Manchester - Palma. Paid for extra leg room which came with priority boarding. Well worth the £15 each way to not stand in the queue to board or worry about not being sat together. The seats are very narrow and each seat is separated by an immovable board so you can not straddle empty seats. Can not understand the reviews of people complaining about getting charged for not having their boarding pass. Ryanair email a week before to tell you that you must check in online. No excuse in the world will get you out of this but you are told by email. They also email you the day before the flight with the hand baggage measurements so no excuses there either. Where they do let themselves down is when the flights are delayed they offered no information whatsoever and there was a four hour wait of everyone staring at the screens. Planes are also often dirty due to them not being cleaned in the short turn around time. As long as you're flying to a proper airport and not a satellite (and end up paying for train/taxi/bus to get 60 miles+ to where you wanted to go!) one then they tend to be the cheapest by a long way as long as you play by the rules. For a 2 hour flight I can get over the lack of service and the slightly uncomfortable seating. Even booking extra leg room they were still 150 quid cheaper than anybody else for return flights.,manchester palma pay extra leg room come priority boarding worth way stand queue board worry sit seat narrow seat separate immovable board straddle seat understand review people complain get charge have boarding pass ryanair email week tell check online excuse world tell email email day flight hand baggage measurement excuse let flight delay offer information whatsoever hour wait stare screen plane dirty clean short turn time long fly proper airport satellite end pay traintaxibus mile want tend cheap long way long play rule hour flight lack service slightly uncomfortable seating book extra leg room quid cheap anybody return flight,0.0024038092233240604,0.04833868145942688,0.16025252640247345,0.02648104354739189,0.013195335865020752,0.6502836346626282,0.09904491156339645,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,28 August I flew FR611 from London to Derry. Ryanair is the only airline flying this route. I therefore had no other option. Not travelling with a printer I needed to obtain a boarding pass at the auto check-in point at the airport. Ryanair refused to issue a boarding pass before I paid an additional 70 pounds almost the same price I paid for the ticket. I could have flown to Belfast and taken a 65 pounds taxi to Derry and still be better off. Attendants refusing to make eye contact said it was Ryanair policy and failure to pay would mean refusal to board yet I am still unsure how I was supposed to know this. It therefore came across as an express strategy to extort funds from passengers. Ryan Air's majority passengers being budget travellers makes this particularly mean- spirited. In all my travels I have never encountered any airline penalising customers for having to issue a boarding pass. I count myself lucky I never have to make use of Ryanair's services again and will actively dissuade anybody at risk of having to do so. The only unpleasant experience during a two week UK holiday and therefore one I recount often. I tried submitting a complaint to the airline directly but the only way of doing so is via snail mail.,august fly fr london derry ryanair airline fly route option travel printer need obtain boarding pass auto checkin point airport ryanair refuse issue boarding pass pay additional pound price pay ticket fly belfast take pound taxi derry well attendant refuse eye contact say ryanair policy failure pay mean refusal board unsure suppose know come express strategy extort fund passenger ryan airs majority passenger budget traveller make particularly mean spirit travel encounter airline penalise customer have issue boarding pass count lucky use ryanair service actively dissuade anybody risk have unpleasant experience week uk holiday recount try submit complaint airline directly way snail mail,0.01558530330657959,0.14751915633678436,0.2644703686237335,0.045842792838811874,0.01534795481711626,0.4210357367992401,0.09019868820905685,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Having used Ryanar for the past 3 yrs travelling to Tenerife Gran Canaria and Reus I we can only fully recommend and thank them for their fast efficient service. This is a budget airline and all extras are stated on booking on their website. For all those who wish to pay over the odds eg. extra £700 per family to fly to a destination then book Thomson or Thomas Cook however we used these one way to Reus and had an hour and half delay compared to every flight with Ryanair on time or usually 10 mins early. Some people just like to complain if you have a young family and want to sit together pre book seats or alternatively use Priority Boarding. I only wish Ryanair flew from Cardiff airport as we would save even more travel costs however it is worth the trip to Bristol as you could never fly a family of 4 from Cardiff for £700 to Canaries.

When we eventually managed to get through the farce of baggage check in we had to open our hand luggage and remove laptops etc but at the same time had to take our child out of his buggy fold that up and put it on the belt then pass ourselves through security scanners whilst our 2 year old son was left to his own devices. Was waiting over half an our in a queue to actually get on the plane at the gate! On the flight only 1 end of toilets was available and people were having to queue behind the stewardesses selling and blocking the aisles! I would never recommend this airline! Don't pay to pre book seats as there was only 50 people on our flight going out so you could sit where you wanted. I'd rather pay more to go with a 'reputable' company.,lanzarote manchester arrive lanzarote airport inform delay baggage check abomination people have open luggage queue item eventually manage farce baggage check open hand luggage remove laptop etc time child buggy fold belt pass security scanner whilst year old son leave device wait half queue actually plane gate flight end toilet available people have queue stewardess sell block aisle recommend airline not pay pre book seat people flight go sit want d pay reputable company,0.0031739454716444016,0.17495812475681305,0.10974876582622528,0.019172491505742073,0.01795770414173603,0.6509525179862976,0.024036457762122154,Topic_6

Ryanair customer review,Edinburgh - Bordeaux for a week's holiday returning on Saturday 6 September 2013. Ryanair does not when you add it all up save money at all. All the extra charges add up to the point where any saving is completely cancelled out. The staff couldn't care less about customers except as in flight cash cows and clearly the airline is not keen on attracting repeat business!! On both legs we were herded like cattle. Bordeaux luggage collection was unbearably slow and there is no access to toilet facilities in the big shed that passes for a terminal - Ryanair don't have access to the main airport terminal. On the return leg we were kept waiting for 40 minutes standing in a queue to board once again in the big shed with no apology for the delay no air conditioning or fresh air - gruesome!!

Ryanair customer review,Kos-Stansted. Our first time on Ryanair and I have to say never again. Stress re-packing our 52kg luggage into the correct number of bags after a day on the beach. Stress getting the hand luggage re-weighed. Stress standing crammed into a much too small area with all the other cattle. No facilities (refreshments or toilets) in 35 degree heat for 45 minutes. Stress barging through to the plane. Stress with the bright lights and constant announcements. No quick hostess service followed by a dimming of the lights so you can sleep. Awoken every 20 minutes to an automated scratchcard announcement. Uncomfortable seats which seem to have less padding than others. I landed with a headache which wrote off the following day.

Ryanair customer review,Flew to Alicante last week. Paid the fee for our measly 15kg bag allowance. Checked in online arrived at Edinburgh to depart to find a massive slow moving queue. My 2 year old was getting tired and cranky. Then was told because my bag was 15.5kg and my wife's was 16kg we would be charged £100 for being over weight if we couldn't re-pack. The ignorant woman at check in couldn't care less about our upset child. We managed to get our luggage re-packed and I was told by another member of staff that my bag would be fine at 15.5kg. When getting onto the plane to get or free for all seat rush. My wife asks for assistance to find at least two seats together but the stewardess snootily told her to keep moving up the plane and find a seat. Luckily somebody moved so that she could sit with our child. Then you have to spend the rest of the flight listening to bored and rude cabin crew trying to sell things.

Ryanair customer review,I thought that I was booking a budget airline and accept all that entails however as the final cost once all the 'extras' such as luggage were added I finally paid over 2500 for my families seats and may as well have gone on a better airline. The plane was clean and it took off and arrived on time. If you are travelling on a weekend break for 2 adults then I imagine it wouldn't be a problem just so long as you read all the small print and adhere to them very carefully however with 4 small children and no way to book a seat it was extremely stressful. I do not understand what they gain by using this system! Would go as far as to say that it is immoral that knowing that you cannot take drinks on board they do not supply water and a small bottle of water is £3! Staff were miserable and openly complained about other passengers whilst stood next to me. They enforce the rules when it suits them. They told a lady that she had to put her cardigan in the overhead lockers but the woman next to me had a handbag on her lap.

Ryanair customer review,July 2012 Bristol to Tenerife. We are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children 10 and 14). We knew that seats weren't allocated but as long as one of our kids was sat with us each we didn't mind. Check in was quick and easy at Bristol as was boarding. Boarding Passes - it clearly states that you have to print them off prior to travelling and you have 14 days to print off your returns if you read the terms and conditions this is quite clear. Yes food and drink is a little expensive but I have never know an airline yet who sell cheap food and drink if you don't like it then buy it in departures prior to boarding. We experience some bad turbulence when landing which meant we had to take off again and land in the North of the Island. After sitting on the tarmac for 30 minutes we were told that buses were waiting for us at the front of the terminal to take us down to Tenerife South other than a little bit of confusion with the staff at the airport this went quite smoothly. People were moaning and complaining about Ryanair and standing in the aisle of the plane when we had all been asked to remain seated until further instructions were given but all I can say is I was happy to land safely rather than Ryanair attempting to land in such bad conditions and put everyone at risk! Staff were friendly enough the return flight was good and they got us back slightly earlier than planned. The plane did not seem anymore uncomfortable than others we have travelled on and it was clean. Lastly if you have young children I recommend you pay for priority boarding or make every effort to get to the front of the queue before boarding if you all want to sit together.,july bristol tenerife family adult child know seat not allocate long kid sit not mind check quick easy bristol boarding boarding pass clearly state print prior travel day print return read term condition clear yes food drink little expensive know airline sell cheap food drink not like buy departure prior boarding experience bad turbulence land mean land north island sit tarmac minute tell bus wait terminal tenerife south little bit confusion staff airport go smoothly people moan complain ryanair stand aisle plane ask remain seated instruction give happy land safely ryanair attempt land bad condition risk staff friendly return flight good get slightly early plan plane anymore uncomfortable travel clean lastly young child recommend pay priority boarding effort queue boarding want sit,0.002062417333945632,0.01148985605686903,0.09093715995550156,0.002795852953568101,0.011232113465666771,0.7543215751647949,0.12716101109981537,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Ryanair is good for its destinations the small airports closer to where you want to go. In the bigger airports their slots are obviously the cheapest and therefore the most inconvenient for passengers. The flights are cramped and the boarding process is very slow. Staff are often pleasant. The flights are not necessarily the cheapest; in domestic Spanish flights for instance by the time you have added a reserved seat and luggage in the hold you can travel cheaper and more comfortably with Iberia or Air Europa. Flights from Spain however to Baden Airpark or Ancona for instance are convenient because they are not routed through hubs with long conveyor belt waiting-times and one can often find an airport close to one's destination.,ryanair good destination small airport close want big airport slot obviously cheap inconvenient passenger flight cramp boarding process slow staff pleasant flight necessarily cheap domestic spanish flight instance time add reserve seat luggage hold travel cheap comfortably iberia air europa flight spain baden airpark ancona instance convenient route hub long conveyor belt waitingtime find airport close one destination,0.004138350486755371,0.1036386713385582,0.09996382147073746,0.025562219321727753,0.0035258422140032053,0.6190689206123352,0.14410218596458435,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Bristol - Malaga. Return flight was booked for family of 4 with 2 bags checked in (already charged £100 for privilege of taking 2 hold bags). For the return my wife had to leave a few days early due to unforeseen circumstances so she departed on a different flight from Seville. At Malaga airport tried to check in with the 2 kids and 2 bags - only to be told had to pay an extra 100 Euros on the spot to 'transfer' one of the bags from my wife to one of the children. Otherwise would not be able to take it. Means I paid approx £130 for the one suitcase plus £50 for the other. Absolute rip off; and the flights were not exactly cheap even before the add-ons. Will never be flying Ryanair again.,bristol malaga return flight book family bag check charge privilege take hold bag return wife leave day early unforeseen circumstance depart different flight seville malaga airport try check kid bag tell pay extra euro spot transfer bag wife child able mean pay approx suitcase plus absolute rip flight exactly cheap addon fly ryanair,0.0041367774829268456,0.20462697744369507,0.3219296932220459,0.005607816856354475,0.003524556290358305,0.42444977164268494,0.03572440519928932,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,I have flown with Ryanair many times and have just returned from Lanzarote flying out of East Midlands I cannot fault the service whatsoever. What I have noticed the same problems occur time and time again. People don't read the rules you don't get something for nothing you know that with Ryanair - accept it. Why do people with children think they have the right to complain when they saunter on to the plane at the last minute and wonder why the are unable to sit together. People get to the check and have to start unpacking cases because they cant be bothered to weigh there luggage. Ryanair is the cheapest not the best I accept that but most of the problems I have seen are caused by the passengers themselves.,fly ryanair time return lanzarote fly east midland fault service whatsoever notice problem occur time time people not read rule not know ryanair accept people child think right complain saunter plane minute wonder unable sit people check start unpack case not bother weigh luggage ryanair cheap good accept problem see cause passenger,0.004387596156448126,0.12931643426418304,0.10732490569353104,0.0059480746276676655,0.003738219616934657,0.631412923336029,0.11787185817956924,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Definitely not for flying with small children. I flew to Poland with my nearly 3 months old daughter and got no help from staff whatsoever. I paid for seat for my little girl however was expected to keep her on my lap as she wasn't allowed to have her own. It would be great if I could just lay her down surely we would both be more comfortable. Also women with kids or pregnant get no priority at the boarding gates staff are rude and treated us as a load not a human beings talking down to us. At the end of the day we are paying customers so show us some respect! Will not fly with them again.,definitely fly small child fly poland nearly month old daughter get help staff whatsoever pay seat little girl expect lap not allow great lay surely comfortable woman kid pregnant priority boarding gate staff rude treat load human being talk end day pay customer respect fly,0.04556350037455559,0.1030048355460167,0.09076013416051865,0.006068595685064793,0.044896360486745834,0.607912003993988,0.10179455578327179,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,My first Ryanair flight was Manchester to Memmingham. What really annoyed me was that my wife and I seemed to be the only people to follow the cabin baggage rules! Everyone else had huge rucksacks that were no way acceptable - and nobody checked at either end! As for families with children and push chairs (have you seen the size of them nowadays) I would ban them from cabins at any price. One saving grace however was that seat backs are fixed in the upright position. Will I travel again with them. Probably yes as it is cheaper than Swissair to Zurich.,ryanair flight manchester memmingham annoy wife people follow cabin baggage rule huge rucksack way acceptable check end family child push chair see size nowadays ban cabin price save grace seat back fix upright position travel probably yes cheap swissair zurich,0.004878148436546326,0.17220862209796906,0.14357110857963562,0.0066129290498793125,0.004156188108026981,0.5638825297355652,0.1046905443072319,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Ryanair informed me that my flights from Liverpool to Rimini had been cancelled 3 months ago only 3 weeks before I was meant to fly. I ended up having to stay at home and lost parking and hotel deposit. Since June I have my flights to Rimini from Stansted booked and confirmed for Christmas. My family who live in Rimini have just informed me that Ryanair is stopping flying there from September so I phoned customer service to find out. I was told yes it was true and asked if I wanted a refund. Is that all you've got to say I inquired. After a long silence I was asked again if I wanted a refund; there was no explanation. To summarize Ryanair know that they are not going to fly into Rimini at Christmas but have no intention on informing the poor passengers who are looking forward to being there for Christmas. Not only they are holding on to everyone's money. They will hold you to ransom nearer the time leaving you no choice but to fly to Bologna or Ancona at inflated prices.,ryanair inform flight liverpool rimini cancel month ago week mean fly end have stay home lose parking hotel deposit june flight rimini stansted book confirm christmas family live rimini inform ryanair stop fly september phone customer service find tell yes true ask want refund ve get inquire long silence ask want refund explanation summarize ryanair know go fly rimini christmas intention inform poor passenger look forward christmas hold everyone money hold ransom nearer time leave choice fly bologna ancona inflated price,0.003128370502963662,0.06685341149568558,0.46545058488845825,0.03537607192993164,0.0026653644163161516,0.3859146237373352,0.0406116284430027,Topic_3
Ryanair customer review,I flew recently from Manchester to Bremen in Germany and am already a regular Ryanair passenger. As always the service worked perfectly. We arrived a few minutes late but I do not think 10 mins matters. Staff are always pleasant if a little unconcerned. I feel a little sorry for them having to sell lottery tickets but it does keep the prices down. I have never incurred charges as I read the rules.,fly recently manchester breman germany regular ryanair passenger service work perfectly arrive minute late think min matter staff pleasant little unconcerned feel little sorry have sell lottery ticket price incur charge read rule,0.005785216577351093,0.03187202289700508,0.16906385123729706,0.007842966355383396,0.004928966052830219,0.6589632034301758,0.12154384702444077,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Our flight from Limoges France to Stansted was cancelled due to poor weather although other planes including Ryanair flights were able to come and go. The next flight from Limoges to Stansted with availability was 3 days later. So we accepted a flight to Leeds the following day. That was all that was done for us we had to arrange our own overnight accommodation transport to and from the airport etc. My advice is if you travel with Ryanair: Make sure you have access to the internet because you need to react pretty quickly when the flight is cancelled as the airports are usually in the middle of nowhere. Know the location of the other airports Ryanair operate. We were offered a flight from Bergerac the next day but the airport staff could not tell us how to get there by train. Don't book stuff for the day after your arrival. There were people in the queue with connecting flights tickets for the Olympics that they could not use. Based on the above I would not travel again with Ryanair if I was travelling to a tight schedule. In total we got home 26 hrs after we planned.,flight limoge france stanste cancel poor weather plane include ryanair flight able come flight limoge stanste availability day later accept flight leed follow day arrange overnight accommodation transport airport etc advice travel ryanair sure access internet need react pretty quickly flight cancel airport usually middle know location airport ryanair operate offer flight bergerac day airport staff tell train not book stuff day arrival people queue connect flight ticket olympic use base travel ryanair travel tight schedule total get home hrs plan,0.03586575761437416,0.03602725639939308,0.3854061961174011,0.004568125586956739,0.002871044911444187,0.470656156539917,0.06460548937320709,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Flying out of Manchester staff friendly and helpful coming back through Palma a different matter. My hand luggage that was the right size going out was deemed to be too large when I was flying home and I was forced to pay €50 and put it in hold leaving me without my pain medication. The priority boarding I had paid for was non existent traveling with small children they tried to split us up eventually got seats together near emergency exit! To add insult to injury they had no food apart from sweets and crisps.,fly manchester staff friendly helpful come palma different matter hand luggage right size go deem large fly home force pay hold leave pain medication priority boarding pay non existent travel small child try split eventually get seat near emergency exit add insult injury food apart sweet crisp,0.00413710530847311,0.1628234088420868,0.16752982139587402,0.005608311854302883,0.003524828003719449,0.570530116558075,0.0858464166522026,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Myself and my daughter took a holiday to Kos. I have never seen such a shambles in my life. After the experience of the free for all to get your seats and then seeing the arguments between other passengers as they could not sit together got the holiday off to a great start. It was now the time for the safety announcements prior to take off I do understand that this is important however I have never seen such miserable faces from the cabin staff. We were sitting in row five and it took nearly 1hr to get served I think mainly because they had to keep explaining what they had run out of even before we took off. The list was endless of what they hadn't got. When it was our turn I ordered 1 bottle of water a whisky and a can of coke I was taken back a little when they said that's 11 Euros. I quickly put my money back in my pocket. All they wanted to do was to sell scratch cards and smokeless cigarettes. Overall not impressed at all and will never travel Ryanair in the future. One final thing. Budget airline? My tickets where certainly not cheap or even reasonable.,daughter take holiday kos see shamble life experience free seat see argument passenger sit get holiday great start time safety announcement prior understand important see miserable face cabin staff sit row take nearly hr serve think mainly explain run take list endless not get turn order bottle water whisky coke take little say s euro quickly money pocket want sell scratch card smokeless cigarette overall impressed travel ryanair future final thing budget airline ticket certainly cheap reasonable,0.03430870175361633,0.15224595367908478,0.09750892221927643,0.032286591827869415,0.0023908778093755245,0.5879285931587219,0.09333036839962006,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Stansted to Pula. Tried to adhere to all rules and regulations but failed to print boarding passes for return journey and hence fined €240 for family of four. This was a genuine error caused by my printing off the outbound boarding passes at too early a stage in my eagerness to do all correctly at which time unable to print for return. Erroneously assumed outbound copies and itinerary would suffice. Hold my hands up and agree nominal fine should be payable but believe that €60 per person is totally disproportionate to administration involved for the error. Walked 5 metres handed over credit card and after a minutes transaction and €240 pound payment returned to check in and allowed to board! Expensive lesson learnt but will avoid Ryanair from now on!,stanste pula try adhere rule regulation fail print boarding pass return journey fine family genuine error cause printing outbound boarding pass early stage eagerness correctly time unable print return erroneously assume outbound copy itinerary suffice hold hand agree nominal fine payable believe person totally disproportionate administration involve error walk metre hand credit card minute transaction pound payment return check allow board expensive lesson learn avoid ryanair,0.03455275297164917,0.0702899694442749,0.22272895276546478,0.10782628506422043,0.03435137867927551,0.3684045672416687,0.16184614598751068,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,When printing the boarding tickets we got our outboard flight no problem and when the home flight boarding card would not print we thought it was due to not actually being away. On our way home the check in lady at Malta said it was going to cost us 290 euros to get home due to no boarding cards even though in front of her on a check list were all the names of passengers and their luggage. After several words and a lot of shouting I paid the money having no other choice. This airline ruined a holiday that was otherwise brilliant and showed no remorse to me and several other unfortunate passengers. This will never happen again because I will never use them again.,print boarding ticket get outboard flight problem home flight boarding card print think actually away way home check lady malta say go cost euro home boarding card check list name passenger luggage word lot shout pay money have choice airline ruin holiday brilliant show remorse unfortunate passenger happen use,0.004300255328416824,0.0787568911910057,0.3567980229854584,0.005829496309161186,0.003663834650069475,0.5142373442649841,0.03641413524746895,Topic_6
Ryanair customer review,Budapest - Manchester and back again with a 5 month old and a 7 year old. Budget flying is fine I was lucky enough to sit in the aisle seat with my baby and my 7 year old sat on the other side of the aisle. I even paid for priority boarding on the way back to give myself just 3 minutes to find a seat next to my own child and get my bags and it made no difference. They put the gate number up people run to the gate 12 minutes walk away they start boarding and I am still trying to push the pram to the gate. A fellow passenger kindly offered to hold my baby while I collapsed the pram at the bottom of the stairs. I still struggled to get on and get seated people pushing past me. I will be seeking my money back for 'priority boarding'. If you have a small child or infant it is not worth it. I flew long haul from Australia with a baby and 7 year old 27 hours worth of traveling and not once felt as stressed and helpless as I did flying Ryanair.,budapest manchester month old year old budget fly fine lucky sit aisle seat baby year old sit aisle pay priority boarding way minute find seat child bag difference gate number people run gate minute walk away start boarding try push pram gate fellow passenger kindly offer hold baby collapse pram stair struggle seat people push past seek money priority boarding small child infant worth fly long haul australia baby year old hour worth travel feel stressed helpless fly ryanair,0.01777074672281742,0.05778985098004341,0.041545767337083817,0.004180764779448509,0.017469407990574837,0.836718738079071,0.024524718523025513,Topic_6

My daughters under 16 years of age were summoned to pay 50 euros each for their hand luggage even though the cases fit the dimensions specified.
