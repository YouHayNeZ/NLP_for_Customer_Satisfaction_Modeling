"""you get what you pay for""","Before August I had never flown with Ryanair because of all the awful reviews I'd heard. However, planning a last minute trip to Barcelona with other low cost airlines proved tricky due to flight times so I bit the bullet and booked with Ryanair. I shouldn't have worried as I really couldn't fault the airline. My boyfriend and I flew out of Liverpool to Barcelona and home again, with great ease. Boarding was simple, as we downloaded our boarding passes to our phones (as we always do whenever we fly, so much easier!). We didn't have luggage to check in so can't comment on that but sailed through boarding easily and were delayed slightly before take off (20 mins or so) once on the plane but it's August summer holidays so to be expected! Staff were all super friendly and very quick coming round with the food and drinks trolley. Yes the food and drinks are expensive in general, and in comparison to other airlines. However, if you have a massive problem with the prices they charge then bring your own food on or just wait until you reach the airport at the other end to eat. Seats are not super comfortable or luxurious but they're decent enough for a short haul flight, and you get what you pay for. Overall would definitely fly with them again.",9.0,1
"""treatment of passengers is inhumane""","I seriously thought we would never get home safely ... but that was not the only terrible part! After a nice week of vacation we take a Ryanair flight from Porto to Milan, estimated duration: about 2 hours (?). We are almost to our destination but we are told that we cannot land because of a thunderstorm. Result: we stay for more than an hour and a half suspended in the sky amid black clouds, lightning and thunders at close range. After that we are told that it will not be possible to land in Milan, so they take us to another airport (without telling us which one, except once we land!). We finally land in Genoa, tired but glad to be on land. Another hour and a half of waiting and we are told that we will be departing again? In the meantime, no one offers us water, food, but the captain tells us that we have ""permission to contact family and relatives,"" if we desire. In the meanwhile, we contact our hotel to alert them to the uncertainty of the situation; they unfortunately warn us that it will not be possible to check in in the middle of the night (it was midnight by then). We arrive at Milan Linate and manage to catch the last shuttle to downtown Milan, where we squeeze into the first hotel next to the Central Station, in order to make as little distance as possible at midnight with baggage and personal belongings. Bewildered but exhausted and thus resigned, we pay three times the price of the hotel originally booked, which did not allow us to have a refund because of the short notice. Finally, once back home we decide to pursue a refund request (end of July 2022), promptly rejected because EU261 regulations do not provide for refunds due to ""unforeseeable"" conditions. We call support again, who suggests we ask for compensation instead of a refund (August 2022). In September 2022 I submit the request, in October 2022 I receive no response (waiting time described by the site for processing the request: 10 days), and decide to call the client support again. The operators, as always rude and annoyed, say they will send a reminder. I have no words for the incompetence of this company, their treatment of passengers (leaving them without water, food, explanations) is absolutely inhumane.",1.0,-1
"""tagged my hand luggage bag""","East Midlands to Dublin. Approaching my flight I followed the instructions to board and someone tagged my hand luggage bag after viewing my boarding card with no explanation. I thought this was a mistake so I removed the tag and then was confronted when boarding the plane by two confrontational girls asking me why i removed it. I explained that I didn't want it putting in hold as it had stuff in a needed as hand luggage and was in a rush when arriving in Dublin, they were rude and and told me I didn't have a choice. This is not acceptable if I wanted my luggage in hold I'd of booked it in hold. That's the whole point of having hand luggage, you have it with you. Poor service, rude staff and diabolical attitude.",1.0,-1
"""made to pay €25 as my bag""","Return flight from Trieste to Stansted. I flew out with a soft hand luggage bag that I have used on countless Ryanair flights, including my outbound trip to Trieste where I was visiting for 3 days. Upon my return, I was made to pay €25 as my bag 'did not meet Ryanair's restrictions'- despite fitting comfortably within the measuring 'cage' that Ryanair staff use to assess whether luggage can or can't fit in the overhead compartments. Despite my bag fitting in the cage (and therefore meeting Ryanair's restrictions), my was deemed too long. Bear in mine this was not a hard-shell style bag but rather a soft leather bag i.e. malleable. The most frustrating part of this was that I had flown out with the same bag, hadn't purchased any additional items, and have used this bag on every flight I have ever taken with Ryanair. In spite of my explanation, the staff had clearly made up her mind and decided I should pay rather than use any sense of initiative. In short, well done Ryanair. Rather than buy a new bag, I will now prioritise competitors like EasyJet and Wow who I have never had such issues in the past.",4.0,-1
"""appalled by their behaviour""","Never again. Not only did they charge me 50 euro at the airport for not checking in online, all of the Ryanair staff I dealt with at Bati airport were so rude and disrespectful towards me. As a young girl travelling alone not knowing the language this was upsetting and extremely uncalled for. One of the worst flying experiences I have ever had. I am really appalled by Ryanair behaviour today.",3.0,-1
"""eight of the 10 flights had delays""","This is my tenth flight with Ryanair this year - and eight of the 10 flights had delays - usually between one and two hours, but we had more than three hours too! There is basically no way anymore that you can convincingly plan longer trips with them, for example a train journey after arrival, because you never know when you arrive. Today, we are loosing another train ticket that we bought ages ago in advance, when we still believed that some delays are exceptions to the rule, rather than the new rule. Even back then, we already calculated with a one and a half hour Ryanair delay, but that is just not good enough for that ""never on time airline"". To make things worse, according to EU law, they only have to pay compensation from a three hour delay, i.e. most delays go without any sanction, meaning a contribution from Ryanair for the additional expenses their customer have to pay. Long live neoliberalism? Add to that the non-existing Ryanair customer-sevice, which leaves you in the dark about new departure time, gate changes etc, and you have the worst package you can possibly buy. What can we customers do about it? At first, let us please stop buying drinks, food and other items on flights that come with more than half an hour delay. We should not reward such an airline for what they do to us. And then better check always the prices of competitors: Eurowings, EasyJet, Vuelin, Wizzair, anything that stays within a reasonable price for the package might be worth considering.",1.0,-1
"""could not fault our journey""","Flown with Ryanair from Birmingham to Fuerteventura return for the first time on our recent holiday.

Ryanair customer review,I flew back from Malaga with Ryanair on 30th August and had no problem whatsoever printed my boarding card as instructed right amount of hand luggage etc. The cabin crew were polite and did their job efficiently. I would not hesitate to book with Ryanair again.,10.0,1
Ryanair customer review,Definitely not for flying with small children. I flew to Poland with my nearly 3 months old daughter and got no help from staff whatsoever. I paid for seat for my little girl however was expected to keep her on my lap as she wasn't allowed to have her own. It would be great if I could just lay her down surely we would both be more comfortable. Also women with kids or pregnant get no priority at the boarding gates staff are rude and treated us as a load not a human beings talking down to us. At the end of the day we are paying customers so show us some respect! Will not fly with them again.,1.0,-1
"""excellent service"" ","After a horrendous journey to the airport, my husband and I arrived 90 minutes before flight. Having been ill on holiday I was exhausted. At checkin, staff were amazing, providing me with water, a seat and wheelchair assistance throughout the airport. Arriving at Stansted there was a vehicle to meet us. We were driven to passport control, where there was a wheelchair waiting for me. Straight through passport control to baggage collection where we were helped with our cases,then to the exit, where we were met by a family member. Thank you Ryanair, excellent service.",9.0,1
"""asked for some kind of compensation""",Rome to Athens. Hands down worst airline ever! We were unable to print out boarding passes at the airport and they were trying to charge us to do so. I was not able to get on our first flight and had to rebook with another airline just to arrive in our destination. The same thing happened on our return flight using them. After spending over three hours on their online chat services which one rude representative disconnected us I was finally able to get them to wave our fee to get on the plane when asked for some kind of compensation for our earlier flight I was promptly told no and disconnected by them yet again. This airline cost us over $500 in fees and lost us two days of our trip to Athens. I will never fly with them again. I would pay triple just to book with a company committed to costumer service which is clearly not a priority with this airline but charging fees for their poor service is the utmost importance to them.,1.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,BHX-DUB-BHX. Flawless flights. All on time with an excellent turnaround time. Cabin clean with polite crew cost 16GBP return. Only hand-luggage printed boarding card and had luggage with me in cabin. Half price hot meals on last evening flight back. As long as you follow the rules you cannot go wrong.,10.0,1
"""everything went very smoothly""","First time on Ryanair for at least ten years and it took the availability of direct flights to the north of Spain to attract us back. We took the business plus option and, while more expensive, it was certainly cheaper than any other option on any route to the same area. We were certainly happy with the service through Edinburgh airport, although there didn't appear to be a dedicated business plus desk available, but the fast track through security and the early boarding were very welcome. Flight departure was scheduled for 6.55am and by 6.25 we were standing outside the airport buildings at the head of a long queue waiting for boarding. This is probably the worst part of flying with Ryanair and such as passengers may be exposed to the elements for quite some time waiting to board, thankfully on this particular morning it was dry, not too cold and bearable. The crew appeared about 6.30 and by 6.40 we were in our seats watching the oncoming passengers in what appeared to be a full load struggling to find overhead locker space and, some their seats. Departure was delayed by half an hour for air traffic control purposes but, once airborne everything went very smoothly and I managed to catch up with some sleep on the way. Cabin crew were friendly, informative and appeared to meet all the needs expected of them by passengers. The return trip was somewhat similar although check-in in Santander was through normal processes, i.e. we all queued up for two desks and took our turn with everybody else to check-in our bags, there was no special service for business plus but that was not a problem as the staff at the desks were quite efficient. Again, the wait outside for boarding, this time in nice sunshine, aboard in plenty of time and airborne exactly on schedule. A newer aircraft this time with the more modern Boeing cabin lighting etc. Good service from the crew and this time we availed ourselves of the excellent coffee and a croissant at an acceptable price. Flight was very smooth and arrival in Edinburgh some fifteen minutes early. Quite impressed with the ""modern"" Ryanair approach and we would be very happy to use them again.",9.0,1
Ryanair customer review,I have flown with Ryanair many times over the past 5 years and require full airport assistance as I am an amputee. I cannot praise Ryanair highly enough. I have never had any problems at all and the staff are wonderful. The Special Assistance team always go that wee extra bit to help. I wish they flew to Newark NJ. and Florida as they could show Continental Virgin etc. a thing or two.,10.0,1
"""Worst airport experience""","Madrid to Porto. Worst airport experience I've ever had. I will preface this by saying I checked in almost 24hrs before my flight and that I have only ever missed a flight once before and United airlines got me on another flight no problem, no fee. I understand that it's your responsibility to not ""miss your flight"" but when I arrived one rep tried to respond to my distress and I believed was berated by another worker in Spanish and then worker became rude to me, one word answers, pointing to arbitrary directions. The next person I spoke to was also rude, I asked about my options and was only given 100Euro exchange of flight option. I asked to speak to a supervisor who essentially threw a pre-written customer service paper at me. I explained that I would just like help and would prefer to do it at the airport. He walked away and I had to follow him and ask again for a number. He again was short and pointed in a direction just saying ""there"". At this point I was very upset because customer service usually responds with sympathy and kindness even if nothing can be done. I waited in line and the initial female I spoke to was avoiding me. I had to insist on receiving a number from the other male rep who reluctantly gave me an incorrect number and did nothing further to help me after I showed him it didn't work. I had to search up a correct number online and at least the rep on the phone was more reasonable, but I will never ever fly Ryanair again. The cheaper fees are made up in baggage fees. You are  locked in once you make a purchase which was terrible because I would have rather paid 200 Euros extra to completely change to an airline that actually cares about their customers. Furthermore, I missed this flight due to confusion on Ryanair airs website and the language barrier. They should provide better instructions to the ridiculous setup at the airport, make it easier to find or provide a general direct address if possible! Lastly, they should actually try to help people and explain things in a reasonable way, preferably with more than one word answers. They're response was not due to language, they were rude from the boarding desk, to the help desk, and the supervisor was the worst of it.",1.0,-1
"""charged 100€ for the same bags""","Flying to Santorini using this same airline, we had no issues. Coming home was a different experience. We paid extra for priority boarding both ways that gave us the option to have a small bag and personal item. The flight from Santorini to Athens was the problem. Because I was close to the front of the line, I watched about 20 passengers go through. They said our bags were too big. They are hard bags so they cannot expand. Mine fit in the bin but “not with room” and my husband was close to fitting in the bin. Therefor we were each charged 50€ (100€ total) for the same bags we brought. They made us pay cash because our credit cards didn’t work. I gave the woman 3 different cards, all of which had worked in the country. As I stood in line because my husband was forced to go to the ATM, I watched 1 bag goes through and one bag of same or similar size does not. The credit card machine never worked once. When my husband asked for a receipt, she said she could not give him one. We made her let us take pictures of everything as a result. She complied that much.  When I showed her my boarding passes and my flight from 4 days earlier in the Ryanair app where I did not have these issues, she and the manager said “other employees did not do their job.”",1.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,"First time flying with Ryanair since 2005 and very happy with the value for money aspect. Ryanair is like a bus. You pay a small fare and they get you where you want to go. The cabin was not luxurious nor was it as clean as a British Airways one but we didn't expect it to be. Didn't love having the safety card stuck at eye-level on the seat in front but again, this is a budget airline. Had a very quick taxi and takeoff from Stagnated which was great and the landing at Krakow was smooth. Great pilots. Love the comical fanfare as you touchdown. Disembarking the plane was quick and we were with our reserved taxi within 20 minutes. On the way back we chose priority boarding which i would very much recommend, especially when its an evening flight and you just want to get home. Overall very satisfied with the service Ryanair provided.",9.0,1
"""no refund was due""",Had an issue with checking in online as it kept coming with an error. Tried to check in at the airport and were told we have to pay the checking fee (60 EUR) but we could then contact the customer service department with proof of the error and we should be able to get our money back. Send them screenshots of the details and 25 days later they replied saying they were not aware of any issues and no refund was due. Really cold and lack of empathy and I will try to avoid flying with them in future unless it's the only choice available.,1.0,-1
"""Definitely use them again""","Manchester to Madrid. A lot of people rubbish Ryanair, but if you follow their requirements you should have a great flight. If you want to be sat next to someone pay for it. Check in as early as possible, use their app. If you want to board early buy the appropriate fare. Arrived 2.5 hours before departure at T3 Manchester to check bags. The Ryanair section was unbelievably busy considering it was 3.45am. However, the line of about 300 people was processed efficiently within 20 minutes. Boarded on time and welcomed by very affable crew. Aircraft had new sky interior and seats which make a huge difference. Plane clean too. Departed on time and crew did usual BOB/scratch card/duty free service. Landed on time in Madrid. The cost £180 for two travellers with a leisure plus ticket( priority boarding, seat selection and 20kg baggage allowance each). Remarkable value. Definitely use them again.",9.0,1
Ryanair customer review,My wife and I fly regularly from Luton to Nimes France we are pleased to get some cheap flights and the journey is not long and we are o/k with the plane and crew but why at Luton do the staff or authorities check our passports and boarding passes and send us outside the departure lounge to wait for the plane to be ready in all sorts of rotten weather under a flimsy open canopy.,8.0,0
"""Plane was very dirty""","Naples to Gdańsk. My first and last experience with this airline. There was no space for legs. Plane was very dirty. I could find chewing gum in magazine or in the table! There was no space for magazines which cabin crew gave out after take-off, that is why magazines were everywhere! Food & drink prices were very high. Cabin crew unpleasant and unhelpful.",1.0,-1
"""easiest way to fly short haul""","I think Ryanair is the easiest way to fly short haul in Europe. First of all it's a low cost so it's very cheap and very easy. But the problem is that because they're a low cost airline, they charge for everything, including food, luggage and a lot more.",6.0,0
"""Ryanair you are absolutely abysmal""","London Luton to Athens. I booked mine and my girlfriends tickets at the same time, I also understood the risk that Ryanair may sit us apart however, when my girlfriend and I are sat 11 rows apart yet both of us have vacant seats next to us. Ryanair you are absolutely abysmal. You are forcing people to pay premiums to chose seats by intentionally sitting them apart. Your price difference is not that much lower that you can do that without people opting not to fly with you. From now on I shall not be using your service again. Your company is and always will be feral.",1.0,-1
"""not recommended""","Ryanair is the worst airline. They will literally make you pay for everything. I went to Rhodes from Athens and then Athens to Santorini with the same carry on, and on the way back to Athens from Santorini staff said that if my carry on does not fit in their thing that ""measures"" our bags I'll have to pay 60€. My carry on was less than 2 kilos. I made it fit and guess what - they didn't have any space in the plane so I had to put it with the checks bags anyways. Ridiculous. Also if you forget to check in 2 hours before they charge you 60€ again to check you in. I've traveled with so many different airlines this one was far the worst one. Not recommended.",1.0,-1
"""proffer two thumbs up""","I returned to Kyiv City (Borispol) from Cracow aboard Ryanair flight FR7262 on the evening of 11 September 2021. Owing to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to complete the check-in process online (due to technical difficulties) prior to my departure for the airport. Arriving at the ticket counter 5 hours before the flight's scheduled departure, I approached the ticketing counter, explained my dilemma to a ticket agent, and with her able and timely assistance was able to implement a work-around on my mobile device which enabled me to eventually obtain my boarding pass. The agent was courteous and patient as she worked to sort out my problem. Ryanair's business model is predicated in hyper efficiency, so traditional ""customer service"" per se often suffers, and often results in decidedly mixed reviews from travelers. Thankfully, there are exceptions to every rule and it is my pleasure to proffer two thumbs up and a well-deserved Five Star rating for my recent experience.",9.0,1
"""never choose Ryanair again""","Cologne to Rome. Very disappointed. Awful experience with the online check-in process and the customer service I got here at Cologne airport by from Ryanair staff. I didn’t know my online check-in has not worked until I got to the airport. There was still time to departure (around 40 minutes, yes not two hours but still good enough) but no one even tried to help me. They firmly gave a big no to me and didn’t even try any alternative solution. Hearing a no after seeing someone is at least trying to help you is different but I got a simple no without any understanding of my situation. I will never choose Ryanair again and I won’t recommend it to anyone.",1.0,-1
"""worst of the budget airlines""","Milan to Stansted. This is the worst of the budget airlines. Tatty planes, horrible over priced food on board, frequently delayed and a multitude of hidden costs.

"""price can't be beaten""","Alicante to East Midlands. Ryanair is a budget airline that i use on a regular basis, and what you see is what you get. I choose them because of price only and if you just book your ticket and not bother with all the silly add ons and take the time to read the webpage when booking, then, generally their price can't be beaten, You have to treat it as a means to get from A to B and take responsibility for choosing a low cost airline.",6.0,0
"""complete lack of customer service""","I am writing my second review for Ryanair and it is only my second time flying with them on a return flight. It is my first and last time flying with them! I strongly, strongly advise you to never ever fly with them on principle alone! Their baggage rules and deadlines are ridiculous. As a whole I paid an extra $162 Euros for a flight that was only supposed to be $94 Euros. In Canadian, that is almost $300 extra dollars so naturally I'm upset. The worst thing about this company is the complete lack of customer service. The carry-on I took to Madrid is built in the dimensions to fit all cabin flights. The exact same carry-on I took from Madrid to Porto was all of a sudden too big to return to Madrid. I tried to explain this to the staff member and the first thing she says to me is, ""I'm just doing my job, it's not my fault they weren't doing their job over there."" Note that this is the exact same company and the inconsistency is frustrating. She asked me to come with her and check the size and in my opinion it fit and she disagreed. I asked to talk to the supervisor who approached me with hostility and attitude. She called me ""baby"" and when I kindly asked her not to call me that she called me it three more times before I refused to speak to her. I went to another Ryanair desk and asked another staff member who must have been instructed by her supervisor to treat me poorly because I simply asked her, ""Where is your customer service desk please?"" All of her body language including rolling her eyes was rude and I asked her why she was giving me attitude when I asked a reasonable question. All she told me was ""third floor"" and when I asked for more specific details she was reluctant and rude the whole time. I followed her instructions just to be told by security that the Ryanair customer service was outside which this staff member did not mention. Not wanting to miss my flight, I opted to pay whatever fee they needed and was met with minimum information, being rushed and two people talking to me at once. Once said I had to pay 25 Euros and the other said I had to pay 50 Euros which I ended up paying with no print out receipt which I had received on the Madrid side. This company can not assume that everyone knows exactly how everything works and they need to learn to treat people reasonably if they are incapable of kindness. On my first experience with Ryanair I interacted with a total of 8 very poor employees the worst of which was the supervisor from Porto who called me ""baby"" after kindly being asked several times not to do that. This company needs to go out of business. They are not worth it. Please do not choose them! People over profit.",1.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,I can not fault Ryanair I use them a lot and will keep on doing so. The biggest issue most of the people in the North West have is: there are no other airports in the North of the country that fly direct to Lamezia or nearby Blackpool would be fantastic Man or Liverpool. Come on Ryanair what's the problem give the customers what they want one a week would be great.,10.0,0
"""flight was cancelled""","Santiago de Compostela to Barcelona. This flight was cancelled, only alternative given to us was to fly 4 days later on the first flight from the company with the same route and with seats. As this was not an option, we asked for refund and bought flights for the next days with other company. Of course the price of these flights were astronomical but we had no alternative as we could not stay four days without flying back home. We put a claim on their site to ask for compensation for cancellation and the refund of the difference between their flight and the new flight we had bought. The answer is: not reimbursing the new flight as we opted for reimbursement of our tickets, and no compensation since the flight was 'cancelled unexpectedly'. This must be the most ridiculous motive to not compensate for cancellation. Other than that: Ground service obviously did not do their job as they did not offer an alternative route (except four days later) and should have offered a place to stay for the night (it was 23.30 when we left the airport). Value for money in this case is terrible: we were refund but somehow lost 10€ between paid and refund, had to buy new tickets from our own pocket at expensive rate. For other times I flew with the company I remember seat being just OK but colour scheme in the aircraft is just terrible to my eyes, blue and yellow plastic.",1.0,-1

"""bucket shop prices, bucket shop service""","London Luton to Murcia with Ryanair. The quality of service received was what we expected. We paid bucket shop prices and got bucket shop service, so no surprises there. The company mantra has always been 'you get what you pay for, so don't moan'. However, my complaint is about the way Ryanair treats its customers in that they don't provide accurate information (in most cases, no information) on delays, corral them like cattle and make them wait for very long periods outside in the rain (return flight from Murcia) with no regard for our well being. Ryanair has been a very successful airline mainly because of ticket price, but as the number of people travelling abroad is slowing down they may want to pay a little more attention to customer care if they want to maintain or improve market share. Price is now no longer enough.",4.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,As a non-EU passenger who lives in London UK I have to fill out a landing card whenever I am coming home. With any other airline landing cards are offered to persons like myself during the flight. This saves time filling it out later at customs. However they are never offered on Ryanair. On a recent flight home from Gdansk I decided to ask the crew for a card since I figured that they would not voluntarily offer one. The crew member stated that they would bring one and did bring me some sort of card which was half in Arabic half in French which appeared to be for passengers arriving in Morocco. It was completely different to the standard form. Later in the flight I spoke to another member of the crew about it pointing out that it was the wrong type of card. She giggled and mumbled something about hanging onto it 'just in case.' I pointed out that she was not making any sense. How hard would it be to carry some landing cards on the flight? If this is for some reason not possible then perhaps the staff need better training in terms of what to do if a passenger request one. Perhaps they could simply tell the passenger 'sorry we do not carry those on-board.' The whole episode was just silly.,5.0,-1

Ryanair customer review,My wife and I are frequent passenger on Ryanair flights our most recent flight was from Shannon to Malaga 20th Aug back on the 10th Sept 2013. I would like to say that if it was not for Ryanair and its cheap flights I would not be able to fly as much as I do all flights with Ryanair have been a most pleasant experience and I have found the staff to be most courteous and helpful. When you book a flight you are told to read terms and conditions so why should Ryanair be to blame. I am looking forward to my next flight.,10.0,1

As a consequence, I was unable to make it for my Ryanair flights within Italy. I tried to reach out to the company several time to inform them about my situation. After several attempts using some kind of useless robot on their website and talking to representatives on the phone, they don't seem to have or want to put in place any customer-friendly measures in this already stressful situation.

"""joke of an airline""","Copenhagen to Kaunas on 23rd of December 2015. The low-cost price of my return Ryanair ticket was € 310. Not exactly what I would call cheap for a 1 hour 10 minute flight. Safety and security instructions were given on a low volume PA system so that few people could barely hear it. Onboard, the seat was filthy from last passengers' food waste, the carpet was filthy with chewing gum, food and chips, and even the shabby looking steward didn't bother to put his shirt inside his trousers. Also, it looked as if his shirt apparently hadn't been ironed for a few weeks. Ordered a drink and a sandwich, was prompted to pay €17. After having done the maths for the stewardess, the price was suddenly €10. Ryanair has some kind of lottery sale onboard their flights. I don't know what this is all about, but it seemed a lot more interesting for cabin staff than the safety instructions. Upon landing in Kaunas I asked a steward what the local time was, but he had no idea that the time zone was one hour ahead of the departure airport. This is a filthy airline, and staff couldn't care less.  Some claim that low-cost is the future of flying. However, I have absolutely no trust in this joke of an airline.",1.0,-1
"""Their arrogance is stunning""","I have flown Ryanair 20+ times and generally felt I got what I paid for. Never again unless there is absolutely no alternative. My May 12 flight to Murcia was cancelled on April 27 (as expected). I immediately requested refund which was acknowledged saying processing within 20 working days and in my bank 5-7 working days later. It’s now August 23 and my money is still in Ryanair’s bank. It is impossible to talk to customer service, I’ve never had a reply from their online chat service (once ignored for 27 hours before I needed to use computer for something else) and the website is full lies. By contrast Jet 2 paid out promptly for a cancelled March flight. During lockdown I have made 4 flight bookings for holidays in 2o21 (ever hopeful), not one with Ryanair. Their arrogance is stunning and if they think this customer is going to forget they are wrong. They are now the airline of last resort.",2.0,-1

The security line at Dublin airport was extremely long, so we asked the Ryanair desk for help. The woman behind the counter was incredibly rude, and just looked at me and said run. She would not help us get through security. So we had to beg people in line and sprint to the gate. The only reason we made the flight was because it was also late. It was a terrible panic.

Ryanair customer review,I fly with Ryanair about 20 times a year. They are consistently reliable and punctual. The only time they let me down was when the ash cloud happened. The prices are fantastic but you have to be flexible to get the best deals. They are not BA but you need the mind set that it is like catching a train and do not expect luxury. But it means I visit my house in Portugal regularly and often pay more for the car parking than the flight.,10.0,1

They wouldn’t talk to us, there was this lady that wouldn’t give her name that was repeatedly shouting ‘you won’t fly today’ and when contacted the service support was you just call your embassy etc. I guess humanity and manners not in the vocabulary of Ryanair, and yes I think one person representing the company is the entire company.",1.0,-1

The new rules about not having the right to bring your hand luggage with you on the plane (small purse + small hand luggage as typical) is absurd.

Furthermore, we are two travelling, and when I made the checkin online the system gave us two seats far away from each other. Next option was; ""You are sitting apart, do you want to sit next to each other?"" Click yes, and an extra supplement is charged to change one of the seats to be next to the other one.

In addition, passengers flying with luggage were left without it, as the luggage was sent to Berlin. And now Ryanair sent me an ""Apology for the flight delay"".

"""service is just the worst""","Ryanair seems attractive because of their cheap prices, but their service is pretty lousy. My flight to London was delayed for almost 3 hours; none of the staff at the gate informed us about what was going on and what the reason for the delay was (only when people started walking up to them and asked, everyone kind of found out from the people sitting next to them). Conveniently the flight was delayed just a little under 3 hours so you're not even able to claim a refund. Because of the delay I missed my connecting flight in London (it was already about 8pm), which is why I went to ask for assistance. Their employee was pretty rude and offered no help; she just told me that I booked the two flights at my own risk and that I wasn't gonna get any assistance by Ryanair. Unfortunately there was no flight left to my final destination that day (which I would have had to pay out of my own pocket, of course), which is why I had to book an overnight bus and had a horrible 24hr trip instead of 8 hrs. On my flights back everything luckily went smoothly, but I noticed that boarding was really chaotic at all flights (a woman with her baby in a stroller was pretty much first in line to board and had to wait about 20 mins until all other passengers had boarded to get some help carrying the stroller down the stairs - of course, staff also weren't able to turn on the escalator at least). I wouldn't fly with Ryanair again, because despite their (in my case not even that cheap) prices their service is just the worst I've ever experienced. I've gone on many flights and faced many delays but have always received assistance and been booked on another flight/hotel etc at the airline's expense. So I was kind of shocked when I got no assistance whatsoever. I would rather pay a little more and have the certainty of knowing I will get help if I'm stranded somewhere.",1.0,-1
"""wallet disappeared into thin air""","Dublin to Gatwick. Barely a minute when I left flight FR116 of 2nd October, 2019, seat no 32F, which was the second to the last seat to the rear cabin area of the plane ( and I was the only one sitting on the row) when I discovered that I have either left my wallet on the seat or it has dropped off on the floor. Earlier in the flight I hesitated changing one of my €50 note to buy £3 water and I told the female cabin crew member same. She asked me what coin I may have and I had €1.20 and she said she was sorry that it's not enough. So I think I mistakenly didn't put my wallet back in my pocket as I intended to. When I made to go back to the parked plane I was told by a security man that I cannot do that and he asked me to make a call on a phone he pointed down at the hall to let them know that I had left my wallet. I made the call and was told that I have to make the complain at the counter. I got to the Ryanair counter in less than 2 minutes and informed the Lady there of my missing wallet. She called someone and hung up and told me the person will call back in 10 minutes. 10 minutes went to 15 minutes and she called back again and was told that the cabin crew members had not found anything. The back n forth went for nearly 40 minutes with me calling customer service who gave me a phone number that hasn't gone through till today. As directed, I went to get the Lost property Contact since I was told that it takes 24 hours for a lost item to be reclaimed. My flight arrived Gatwick a few minutes past 5 but I ended up leaving the airport by 7:30pm because I didn't have money to pay for a taxi home and couldn't reach family that could help. My Credit and Debit Card, plus €101.20, £1 and Oyster card was in that wallet. Finally, a friend helped booked me a Taxi. I can't believe that my wallet disappeared into thin air.

"""seats rather numbing after a couple of hours""","Opted for Ryanair to fly Liverpool to Malaga and back rather than preferred easyJet on grounds of timings and price. Booked the return flight separately as paying in euros saved money, even using my credit card. Had problems trying to check in online as our computer does not seem to like the new Ryanair website and in the end could only do so via the old so-called Legacy website, only to discover that airport security and boarding gates struggle to read the boarding codes. Outward flight was fine and everyone seemed to get their hand luggage on board despite the flight being full. The return journey was less satisfactory. It was delayed by an hour with no explanation or apology given. Boarding at Malaga was in 3 groups: priority first, then rows 22 - 33, then everyone else. We could see that it made sense to board the back rows first when using an airbridge, but some prior warning would have been helpful as the existence of the display notices indicates that it is Ryanair policy. Then as the rest of us were boarded, the boarding agents immediately began to tag our cabin baggage for free hold storage without any warning, which necessitated extracting items wanted on board as we waited beyond the gate. It seemed that there must have been a pre-determined number of passengers to be selected for hand luggage removal as those at the back of the queue were allowed to keep their bags. In fact, as there was a large school party on board with minimal hand luggage, there would have been plenty of room for everyone's bags. We couldn't help feeling unfairly treated as we were near the front in the original queue, but relegated towards the rear and then selected for baggage extraction as well. The flight itself was ok, though we do find Ryanair seats rather numbing after a couple of hours. Those who ordered food, however, were very discontented as it took so long to appear - some did not get theirs till the descent into Liverpool had already begun.",5.0,-1

Ryanair customer review,"Second round trip with Ryanair this year and all went fairly smoothly. Had booked early for a good price and managed to check in for return flight at home before leaving for Liverpool airport early in the morning, so avoided any extra charges. Did have a 30 minutes delay on the outward journey which was attributed to Belgian ATC because of the ""very busy skies over Europe this morning"", but since boarding (for an early morning flight) did not start till about 20 minutes before scheduled departure time I suspect we simply missed our designated slot. Also there was a puzzling request from the cabin manager that passengers should make sure they sat in their allocated seats because of the carefully arranged weight distribution. Given that the plane was completely full, how and where was weight distribution arranged? Plenty of sales pitches on both legs, but my impression was that many of the passengers just switched off and sales were actually fewer than on flights I've had with easyJet. None of the past quibbling over cabin baggage and even on the full outward flight everyone seemed to get their bags stowed in the lockers with crew members' assistance. Ryanair certainly seems to be more passenger-friendly these days but it is still advisable to be aware of the rules to avoid any possible pitfalls.",7.0,0

Ryanair customer review,Travelled 24/8/14 FR8747. The return to Stansted on Ryanair from La Rochelle was ok. The experience at La Rochelle was ok and the inbound flight arrived 15 mins early. Boarding began at 10 for our 10.30 flight. The doors where shut at 10.30 and the safety demonstration was played in English and then French. We were off around 10.35 just 5 mins behind schedule. The inflight service began with drinks and snacks. I had a pepsi which was in a small can. Then the duty free service before rubbish during our decent over London. We landed just before 10.45 10 mins early. Yet again no fanfare but a little announcement about there low fares and the fact they have a 90% punctuality record. Overall they just get you there on time which is really all that travel is so I would recommend them if you are on a budget or Stansted is your local airport.,7.0,0
"""Kafkaesque and dispiriting""","Manchester to Nuremberg. The actual flight was not a problem but my check in baggage was. I had pre-booked a suitcase on the flight. My wife had too. Her passport is from the UK: her bag went straight through at the check-in counter. I have a Australian passport and my bag was weighed, tagged and given back to me to carry to another part of the airport for some sort of separate inspection. At the ""Special Inspection"" station I put the bag on the belt and it zipped away - there was no 'inspection'. I have traveled in and out of the UK for 40 years on other airlines and never had to do this sort of ridiculous procedure before. To add insult to injury I had submitted my German residency card and passport for stamping at the check-in counter but the desk attendant didn't stamp my boarding pass and I was given a lot of grief at the gate for 'not having a visa check'. Kafkaesque and dispiriting - next time I will go on Lufthansa and save the grief.",4.0,-1
"""as basic as cheap flying can get""","Ryanair is as basic as cheap flying can get. Your initial costs seem low but you should add the price of an additional passenger to your calculations, in case anything will go wrong. We booked two flights over Ryanair. Dortmund to Katowice and vice versa. As all cheap airlines, Ryanair has strict measurements for the size of the luggage you're allowed to bring. While boarding the machine on the first flight, Dortmund to Katowice, our Luggage was measured by the ground and fit into the Ryanair restrictions. While boarding the flight back the very same luggage somehow did not fit into size regulations, and we were charged an additional 310 PLN (about 71,82€ at current rates) per piece of luggage. All that while other passengers that went by with visibly larger luggage were not asked to measure and could proceed to board unbothered by the ground staff. In addition, as we boarded the machine, the staff informed us that our Luggage would be too large to store it in the cabin, and had to be transported inside the cargo department of the plane. Which of course comes with extra waiting times at the airport. In addition, we booked a rental car at Katowice Airport over Ryanair. Of course, there where some problems with the booking and we had to cancel the booking and ended up paying about 70% more for the car as we initially would have.",4.0,-1
"""this is by far the worst""",Rome to Athens. I have flown on many airlines but this is by far the worst. If you do not have tickets confirmed and printed before 2 hours expect the printing to cost as much as the flight itself. Upon going to the gate the people at the ticket desk were randomly telling people their bags were too big and charging them 50 euros to check at the gate. There was no rhyme or reason to it people were selected at random. Some had larger bags that were getting through those that were stopped. Their comment every time was that you booked a cheap flight what did you expect. Do not go with this airlines because although it is cheap when you add up all of their random fees you can get a better flight with someone who is upfront with their charges.,1.0,-1

"""bad situation made worse .... fly with Ryanair""","Due to the closure of a section on the M25 we arrived at Stansted with only one hour to go before our flight left. Knowing we were in trouble and seeing the hundreds waiting to be checked in, I joined a queue at Ryanair customer service to ask how we should proceed. Mrs miserable at the 'Here to Help' counter uttered that same litany, as if we had arrived late on purpose just to annoy her - ""Check-in opens 3 hours before you fly"". Her head twitched sideways and she announced ""check-in 80' (where another long queue was waiting), then turned her back on us. When our turn finally comes after one assistant has closed up and gone home leaving only two operating, we are told we are too late and the gate is closed. If you want a bad situation made much worse then fly with Ryanair. Of course this is a very lucrative action by Ryanair as people are then offered - ""as a gesture of goodwill"" the chance to buy another flight for £100 per head.",1.0,-1

Flights were cancelled while the planes sat at the gates, unable to take off because of weather (they said, other airlines were landing and departing). They emailed us to notify us of the cancellation - no staff to help at the gate. It was chaotic. The lines at Dublin airport were hours long and they encouraged us to leave the queue to book online. Their website, poorly designed by any standard, could not handle the traffic and we could do nothing. I finally ended up booking a flight on Aer Lingus just to get out of there.

"""encourage not to fly with Ryanair""","We had the worst experience with Ryanair last month. To begin with, they do not have airport check-in and boarding pass printing. Their system is based on the customer bringing his/her boarding pass ahead of time. We did not realise this, and they send us to pay 50 Euros for each ticket (for a family of 5 it was 250 Euros). Payments are done in a different ""office"", so I had to go there and stand for 20 min in a very unorganized line. When I came back to check-in the agent was very upset that we didn't pay for our suitcases, almost yelling at us. Guess what? we didn't know about this as well. So now she sent me again for the same ""office"" to pay another 200 Euros. Now, however there is only one line instead of two, so it takes another 30 minutes to pay the fee. Overall, their service is the worst that I've experienced. They make you feel as if they are doing you a favor for allowing you to fly their planes. I encourage anyone who wants to fly at a low cost not to fly with Ryanair. Overall it comes out to a very expensive experience.",1.0,-1

Even though I paid for every piece of luggage a head of time, at the counter they charged me 49:00€ for the luggage I checked in. To pay that charge she sent me to another counter pointing to a row of counters, refusing to provide information as why I am going there and Ordered me ""go there!"".  Here this, on that counter which I don't know the name, they said we don't know why she didn't explain and they referred me back to her, but before they sent me away and charged me 68.00€ for not checking in ahead.

Ryanair customer review,"I'm starting to fly this route more regularly, and for the first time have to report what I consider to be a significant failing with the cabin crew. Our plane (FR7974) left late (after a late inbound arrival). I was sitting in Row 2. There was a minimal announcement from the flight deck naming the crew but nothing to invite the passengers to listen attentively to the safety briefing, which is often the final point made during the cockpit pre-flight passenger announcement. The announcement was very quiet and the delivery was monotone. I appreciate that the flight deck crew wanted to get a slot and head back to London as quickly as possible so their priorities might be elsewhere. The pasenger safety briefing was voiced by the female cabin crew member but it was impossible to hear (even in row 2). Even the young man doing the demonstration seemed frustrated by the lack of interest being shown. When I asked the female cabin crew why she had not stopped the briefing and reminded the passengers to pay attention, she told me it was not really worth it, because 'they (the passengers) wouldn't do it and anyway they fly so regularly that they don't need to listen to it because they know what to do by now'. The drinks run and duty free run were very speedy, leading to the crew spending around 10 mins in the forward galley area spilling out into the aisle in full sight of the passengers each with a mobile phone in their hand and chatting. Apart from the young man cabin crew at the front who made a personal, animated and delightful appeal for the scratch card run, and whose cabin service was friendly and most welcome, this cabin crew seemed to be the most uninterested and switched off that I have travelled with in over 15 years of travelling with Ryanair.

I was very concerned for my baby granddaughter who was sweating profusely and we were in this situation for approximately 15 minutes. Why did that happen, could we not have been held back in the departure lounge. It was appalling and of course no offer of any water. On the flight there were members of staff, or I assume they were, who were helping uniformed staff but one was in shorts and t-shirt and the other casually dressed.

Absolutely no room on the aircraft, felt like a pack of sardines, virtually no comfort. There were a group of men drinking beer standing at the front end of the aircraft for nearly the whole duration of the flight which I thought was odd and unsettling.

It's true that they have the best price initially, but they have so many hidden costs it's obscene and I really feel strongly that a reputable airline is the way to go. I will never fly with Ryanair again. The staff member we met to check in was the rudest person I had ever dealt with in customer service - I don't even know how to describe it, the whole interaction left me in a very sour mood - she informed us that because we had not done the online checkin two hours before our flight (we were standing in front her 1 hour and 45 minutes before our flight, without exaggeration), we now had to pay £100 to have her check us in. This was more than both our tickets combined. It was 6:30 in the morning, and we were the only ones there. I couldn't believe it. The next lady we spoke to who was charging us this fee advised that we had 'checked our email wrong' since there should have been a reminder (there wasn't- I went back and checked, even the junk box). The booking email does mention this fee at the end of the page. If this airline wants to save money by limiting staff and doing things online, I support that - but I should have still been able to check in myself then at that time - to cut off the online checkin 2 hours before and charge a ridiculous fee at that time is just shady, wrong and I felt so angry. They already have additional costs for everything - we had paid to check our bags, and we had paid extra for 'priority' seating so our seats were already reserved - so why would we check in??? So angry and disappointed. The worst part is, this airline clearly does not care about what their customers think, and that makes the customer totally powerless to ensure that the service they're receiving is fair, and this case it's not.

I flew to Zaragoza for a short business trip two days ago and everything went very smoothly: on-time departures, clean aircraft, friendly and polite crew. The price was EUR 120 return but I booked just 9 days before so it is still a good price considering this destination is very difficult to be reached via Madrid or Barcelona and a direct flight from my hometown is a huge plus.

This year alone they have told a party of 7 that they could either change there flight date or receive a full refund due to a Covid related issue, we selected the refund but did not receive anything, when we contacted them again they said that they could not give a refund but could change the flights, which we then agreed to, again we heard nothing further and the flights did not change, once again we contacted them and they said that they could not change the flights and we would have to wait for a refund, after several more conversations we ended up changing the flights.

I cannot express in words what a poor excuse for a company they are and my dealings with them have left me feeling that there should be much more stringent rules and regulations governing how airlines operate, I can’t think of any other business where you could change what you are selling to a customer and not be liable to pay them back in full immediately. If you have any other options for flights to any destination in the world then I would strongly recommend you take them as this company does not care for its customers in any way and will offer no help of something goes wrong with your travel plans.

Ryanair customer review,Flight out on the 29/4/15 was ok flight back not so good 3/5/15. No food left only chocolate snacks and crisps staff seemed as if they didn't know what they was doing slow and no organisation started from the front of the plane and we was at the back row 33. So not much left anyway but no sandwiches at the front of the plane as was sold out on the flight out. Very cramped. Paid for seats going out and to put a case in the hold (£60) return what a rip off. But refused to pay for seats to come back. Will not travel with them again if I can help it.,2.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,Dortmund-Krakow RTN. Avoided Ryanair because of their aggressive policy but decided to give them a try again. Finally Ryanair has understood that free seating leading to a scrum has had its longest time. The allocated seating for decent fees is a big improvement. Onboard only harassed once for a lottery. No constant announcements for buying this and that anymore. Leg room stays a problem though as they press 198 passengers into a Boeing 737-800. Wouldn't bear a FR-flight longer than two hours. All in all a decent experience for less than 200 euro rtn for two including bag priority boarding - worked well but isn't really necessary anymore with allocated seating - and reserved seat. If you reserve a seat at the time of booking you can can check in 30 days prior to departure. Well worth the extra fee for people who complain they can't print their boarding passes while being away from home.,7.0,0

Yet another Ryanair flight where most passengers are booked as 'priority' - the queuing ropes had to be repositioned as the priority queue was so long. Less than 20 in the 'other Q'.

The member of staff was not interested in the fact I had buried my father the day before and was insensitive and rude. On boarding the aircraft, I photographed numerous bags in the overhead luggage of the same dimensions as mine, on questioning the other passengers they had not been charged any extra for this luggage.

Both on time booked seats for extra comfort and staff were courteous and efficient. However on return to Glasgow (PIK) it was torrential rain. We were put off the plane onto the runway to make our way into arrivals.

For the first time ever I decided to try Ryanair food and was pleasantly surprised - the lasagne was tasty, of decent proportion, and at €15 for this plus a bottle of wine, fruit cake and coffee not bad value. The crew were smart and cheerful and helped us with our luggage at both ends. Of all the L.C.C. Ryanair are our favourite - always offering what they say and at the lowest cost.

It was cheaper to fly to Dublin for the day on Ryanair rather than go to London from Bristol for the day by rail. Although the seats do not recline, I thought the leg room was fine. I have flown Ryanair several times over the years and have come to the conclusion that as long as you stick to the rules with regards checking in on line and adhere to luggage sizes, journeys are hassle free generally. Flight was late on the return leg but they emailed an apology before the dedicated check in time. That didn’t bother me personally. Their website is designed to capture more money related to seat allocation, earlier checkin, luggage upgrades, insurance, etc etc but they are optional and as long as you know what you want, there is no obligation to increase the price of your journey. I find their website and online check in very easy to use. I’m a pensioner and I’m grateful Ryanair offers fares at great value.",9.0,1

Do you want 1hr to board a plane? Do you want 1 hr to disembark a plane? If the answer is yes then simply don't choose Ryanair! Are you someone who has several bags?

"""vow never to fly Ryanair again""","I booked tickets from Stansted to Valencia for me and my partner at the same time. The latest money grabbing trick by Ryanair is to seat a couple at the furthest ends of the plane from each other, even when the plane has 90% empty seats, so that if you want to sit together you have to pay to allocate a seat - I have got to say I have been waiting years for them to work this one out - so predictable. This now goes beyond cheeky and is into the realm of despicable behaviour. Seats have always been filled on a first come, first served basis until now, so it is clear that this is done on purpose so as to generate more profit. But do you know what? This profit is not going to be coming from me, as I vow never to fly Ryanair again. I am a very regular flyer who tends to sway towards budget airlines, so EasyJet will be seeing much more business from me in future (unless they try the same filthy trick as Ryanair).",1.0,-1
"""lot of ground to make up""","Manchester to Bratislava. Ryanair have much improved since I last flew with them around 5 years ago. Cabin crew both ways were friendly and their new uniforms look the part. The two bag policy is good and it sets them apart from other carriers and I'm glad they no longer micro examine the size of every carry on bag in the hope of eliciting some more money for a minor infringement - but truth be told, they've a lot of ground to make up on other low cost carriers who started to improve their customer experience long before Ryanair did. The seats are uncomfortable and cramped. No seat pocket annoys me and puts me off buying anything (still way overpriced). As does the broken tray table with a 45 degree slant meaning anything placed on it rolls into your lap. The fan fare on arrival irritates and is frankly crass. The seat rest and overhead bin adverts make remind me of a bus. The toilet is cramped.  The occupier of the aisle seat next to me had a bag that didn't fit under the seat in front of him resulting my having to clamber over it to get out mid flight. That'd be fun in an emergency. I know they are upgrading their fleet with new seats and interiors and I realise they make a lot of short journeys so wear and tear is inevitable, but Easyjet manage to provide more comfortable and clean aircraft with a better environment so why can't Ryanair? Particularly as their prices are no longer quite as competitive as they were. I'll use them again where I have to but given a choice of paying 1/3 more and travelling with someone else, I will.",5.0,0
Ryanair customer review,My first Ryanair flight was Manchester to Memmingham. What really annoyed me was that my wife and I seemed to be the only people to follow the cabin baggage rules! Everyone else had huge rucksacks that were no way acceptable - and nobody checked at either end! As for families with children and push chairs (have you seen the size of them nowadays) I would ban them from cabins at any price. One saving grace however was that seat backs are fixed in the upright position. Will I travel again with them. Probably yes as it is cheaper than Swissair to Zurich.,6.0,0

Boarding was fairly smooth but involved a bit of queuing up, this is by no means unique to Ryanair though. Plane was new, and seats were the thin type which means you have a passable amount of legroom. Had food on board - selection was actually good, price was reasonable and quality was ok. I just don't understand why so many people still criticise this airline - you're paying budget prices - what do you expect? Just don't be an idiot and turn up with excess baggage or having not checked in. Ryanair must send about 10 reminders about this, but some people seem to still miss it. Or, they figure they will just do it anyway, and then stamp their feet to get an exception - don't bother - you're just wasting your time and money, and you will stress yourself out. My two detractors are 'priority' is not really priority these days, because half the plane has it, it should really be seen as a cabin suitcase surcharge, and I think Ryanair may as well just rename it as that. Also, if you have young kids, probably not the best choice because you will probably have to queue up a bit and use a bus to get from the gate to the plane.",9.0,1

My round trip flight from Dublin to Glasgow was only $45 but it was another $40 checking in my bags. You’d think they’d offer free return bag check in considering it was round trip. When I got to the airport this morning they charged me 90£ because I forgot to check in online (50£) and to recheck my bags (40£) in to return to Dublin. I checked my bank account and it was $122. That’s an absolutely ridiculous amount just to “check in.” I will never be flying with Ryanair again.,1.0,-1

A registred baggage of 15 kg now costs 35 Euro (compared to 15 not so much time ago), if you want to sit near a person you travel together with you have to pay (previously persons checking in together were placed beside each others).

It's also clear on luggage restrictions, and penalties for not checking in online. My main criticism is that boarding, especially at Stansted, was chaotic: queuing down a stairwell, and then waiting a good 10 minutes on the tarmac in blistering heat. Why doesn't boarding begin when the aircraft is ready? Seats OK for a short-haul, cabin staff did their job.

All crammed into a waiting area so hot people pushing and queue jumping priority went through and some passengers that were not priority pushed their way in and were not stopped what is the point of paying when you can just push in? The aircraft was filthy and I had to sit with my feet in biscuit crumbs crisps bread crusts empty drink bottles - it was disgusting. Even when the seatbelt light was on people kept getting up and fiddling with their luggage. Also when the cabin bags were checked many of them pushed and shoved their bags in the testing rack - so much so that one man pulled his handle off and threw it across the airport floor! This testing of cabin bags does not work as several should have been in the hold but these people wanted to get away with paying and were arguing with the airport staff who jut let them through therefore Ryanair is losing out on payments for luggage and honest passengers are paying the price it needs to be sorted!,3.0,-1

I reminded her what she said last time about the two bags being okay to bring onboard, but she denied saying that and then started to argue with me. I stopped talking to her as she was very rude. She then kicked me out the line and said I need to stand in another if I need help. Eventually I spoke with another Ryanair lady who was very kind and explained what had happened.

So this now means that I will have to find an internet cafeé whilst on holiday or pay 70 euros for each boarding pass. What a scam. Just cannot understand Ryanair on this one.

We had no problems stowing our luggage in the overhead lockers (which we had carefully measured to ensure it was the correct size after reading too many horror stories of people with oversize cabin baggage). The flight attendants were friendly. We hadn't realised we needed to have our boarding passes stamped by a visa check person at the Ryanair desk before security (it was on the ticket but we just hadn't read it). We were lucky that the staff at the gate kindly offered to do the visa check for us instead.

the crew who was stood near to my seat told me my bag should've been left at the entrance and put in the hold. I had at no point before this been told to do so. The aisle was rammed with passengers but she still wanted me to take my bag off the plane. After much discussion I persuaded her to let me put my bag in the overhead where there was plenty of space and I would remove it if necessary. I sat and watched many more passengers board who had arrived much later than me (no stickers on their bags) as it happened there was plenty of space in the lockers so my bag stayed put.

"""an extremely frustrating experience""","I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with Ryanair that left me disappointed and dissatisfied with their service. Despite it not being mandatory to complete web check-in for my flight, I was unjustly charged a hefty fee of 40EUR due to an error on their part. Upon arriving at the airport, I was informed that I needed to pay the additional fee because I had not completed the web check-in process. However, according to Ryanair's own policy, web check-in is not mandatory, and passengers are still able to check in at the airport without incurring any charges. I found it incredibly unfair and frustrating that I was penalized for their own mistake. The customer service representative I approached for assistance was unhelpful and unsympathetic to my situation. They showed no willingness to resolve the issue or provide any explanation for the unnecessary charge. This lack of professionalism only added to my dissatisfaction. As a frequent flyer, I have had positive experiences with several other airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and go above and beyond to rectify their mistakes. Unfortunately, Ryanair fell far short of these expectations. The incident left a sour taste in my mouth and has significantly impacted my perception of Ryanair as a reliable and customer-centric airline. The lack of transparency and the unwarranted charge have made me question their commitment to customer service and fairness. I strongly advise other travelers to be cautious when booking with Ryanair and to carefully review their policies and fees. It is disheartening to experience such disregard for customer satisfaction, and I hope that Ryanair takes this feedback constructively and works towards improving their service and rectifying their mistakes. Overall, my experience with Ryanair was deeply disappointing, and I cannot recommend them based on the unjust charges and lack of accountability I encountered.",1.0,-1

Surprised to be allocated the same back row seat for both flights even though I'd not paid for seat choice. I thought these rear (and front) seats cost extra? Anyway not complaining as it meant speedy disembarkation at both destinations. Good to see that the Ryanair charm offensive has not run out of steam and they really do seem to be making serious efforts to up their public image. Return leg absolutely full but boarding was efficient enough and we arrived 20 mins early. Both flights were on two of FR's more elderly planes (those in the EI-DC* range) and frankly they are starting to show a lot of wear and tear which is hardly surprising when you consider how hard they work. Have the food and drink prices gone up recently? £4.50 for a coffee and a biscuit seems a bit OTT to me but I guess you don't have to buy. In summary a couple of years ago I'd have advised anyone to avoid Ryanair at all costs if there was even a vaguely convenient alternative. Happily nowadays I'm quite keen to recommend them to anyone on any route if getting from A to B in the shortest time for the least money including bags etc is a priority.,8.0,1

So I crossed the terminal and waited in queue at the Swissport Desk for 40 minutes with several other people who were in the same situation. Everybody looked angry and worried because there was only one agent handling customers, and she was moving very slowly. When I finally got my turn, it was too late. The gate had closed. When I told this to the slow attendant, she was exceedingly rude, remarking that I should have ""spoken up"" from the queue if I had an imminent flight. The problem was, every single person in the queue was in the same position that I was. Ryanair wasn’t letting anybody pay for their baggage at the baggage desk! Was I supposed to cut in line?

I tried sending the form several times but the unique booking reference number was not recognised. I have tried phoning the customer support numbers on their website, the first was out of service and the other two I was told they were busy and was cut off. So unless I write to them its likely I will not get my money back.",2.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,"I'm very satisfied with the service on board. We flew as a family. Both flights to Tenerife and Warszawa were on time. The food isn't cheap but worth it. Some people say that the seats are uncomfortable or there is not enough space, but found them perfectly adequate. The aircraft was in excellent condition. I will fly with Ryanair again.",10.0,1
Ryanair customer review,We went with 6 people (4 adults and 2 children). We accidentally had two pieces of luggage too much (this was our own fault) so we paid the extra other airlines do the same so its not just Ryanair. Boarding was very smooth and the children received special attention from a friendly crew member. Plane landed on time in Rome. Return was about the same. I fly regularly with Ryanair and I never had any problems. Delays are hardly the mistake of the airline but of the airport and the airport handling so you cannot blame them for that. Also people flying with Ryanair don't want to pay much for their tickets but they complain about the people paying the extras like priority boarding. Some passengers not paying for the extras were complaining why we could get on first! Also if you preselect your seat with a small extra you can print your boarding pass (also for the return flight) at home. Even with all the extras Ryanair was the cheapest solution. So to be frankly not Ryanair is the problem but some people flying with Ryanair are. Ryanair is very clear about their rules and I really don't understand why people don't obbey them? Do they do it on purpose maybe hoping they get the full service and not paying for it? I like Ryanair they bring you very safely from A to B for very little money. I don't expect much from them but I am always surprised they give good service for the money you pay.,10.0,1

"""a flawless, efficient flight""","Flew from Cologne-Bonn to Berlin. Absolute bargain at 12.98 euros one way. Since I went for the low price I didn't want to add any extras, so no reserved seat. It's irritating how Ryanair keeps pushing you to buy a seat 'or maybe you won't sit together'. On the outbound flight the computer put as together at an A and B-seat but on our way back we were punished for not buying our seats: my wife and I were seperated about 15 rows and put both in a B-seat. Why is a mystery since there were enough seats next to each other and the cabin crew allowed me to join my wife. I would suggest that Ryanair stops this mocking of passengers. Apart from that: a flawless, efficient flight with not too friendly crews, but it gets you form A to B for a really low price,,so in that regard they keep their promise. I even noticed more legroom thans to new seats.",8.0,1
Ryanair customer review,Stansted to Budapest return. Both flights left a few minutes late and arrived almost on time. Cabin crew worked hard seats were not too uncomfortable. By following the rules we purchased and paid nothing additional - hence it was great value. The new seven day check-in rule is a bit of a pain because it applies for each leg of the trip separately. So (seven days in advance) we had to check in for the flight out on the 12th May and for the flight back on the 14th. It would be nice to be able to do them both on the same outward day.,9.0,1

According to the ladies there checking our boarding passes, we had to have a visa card and they wouldn't board us on the plane. We thought there was a confusion since we arrived just fine with the same exact documents, same airline, same airport the day before and we had no problem through security but they appear to have a problem and wouldn't let us on the plane. We were trying to explain to them that we are European citizens and that we do NOT require visa. They wouldn't listen to us or even try to help us since we couldn't understand their response which was unreasonable! Everyone is boarded but us two and the gates closed and we started panicking, we couldn't believe that they will actually leave us. Until one lady that was working there too, thought that there was something wrong and she tried to help us by just calling her superior to come and check if we do need visa and she just simply said ""no we do not need visa"" . That was it! That was all needed to be done by the staff members who didn't care leaving two girls alone in a foreign country.",2.0,-1

It was a good landing too. And we parked at a gate and not at a stand which was great. Only concern that happened is I waited about 1 hour and 20 mins to get to the plane.

This is nothing but a sneaky way for them to nickel and dime unsuspecting passengers. Not only that, but the staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful throughout the entire process. They seemed to take pleasure in making my experience as miserable as possible. I've flown with a lot of budget airlines in the past, but Ryanair takes the cake for being the worst.

Ryanair customer review,STN-DUB-STN; I was expecting the journey from hell on the way out but in fairness the outward journey was far from unpleasant however the seat wasn't brilliant it was harder than a rock however there wasn't much in the way of on-board advertising on the way out and we were in Dublin on time. The return flight a few days after was quite badly delayed we were probably in the air about 30 minutes after we should have left Dublin. We did board and got underway after a while but there was the substantial delay (which went without explanation) and then they had the audacity to start flogging superfluous amounts of miscellaneous tat. After spending an hour in a queue in Dublin T1 I don't want perfume or scratch cards I want quiet!

The flight itself was as good as can be expected. The cabin crew especially 1 young woman was friendly and welcoming. As there were several empty seats at the front they allowed passengers to use those seats. The plane took off more or less on time and arrived to Birmingham on schedule. 1 thing I will say about the priority boarding is, it's worth the extra money, it allows you and your partner/family sit together and gives some order to boarding having 2 lanes, I remember when it was 1 queue of boarding it was chaotic and seemed much longer to board.",8.0,1

"""couldn't sleep for more than 10 minutes""","Budapest to Lisbon. Last weekend was the first and last time I've ever flown on Ryanair. In a 4 hour flight, where I would've normally slept through the entire flight, I couldn't sleep for more than 10 minutes straight because various carts - with food, perfumes and various other items for sell - were passing every 15 minutes, and because of constant announcements made by the crew. When I complained to my boyfriend, a fight attendant told me, very rudely 'ma'am this is the walking cabin, it's normal for the crew to be walking up and down with carts'. Maybe in Ryanair this is normal, but certainly not in other companies. When I arrived to Portugal, it took more than an hour - 1 hour and 12 minutes to be precise - for the bags from this flight to start to arrive. Two other fights that arrived much later already had their bags delivered on our mat, while we were still waiting. When asking Ryanair employees about what was going on with our bags, they said they couldn't help us or give us any information, as they didn't know.

"""Avoid like the plague""","Gran Canaria to Stansted. Ryanair is now just a complete joke and pretty identical to the airlines depicted in come fly with me. Working out whether you’ve paid for luggage or not is deliberately unclear and I’d paid for only one way. You are deliberately seated apart, regardless of when you check in so you have to pay to sit together. Over two thirds of the plane had paid for priority boarding that comes with hand luggage so the queue was as long as if they hadn’t. The team are completely disorganised and ended up rushing through on both flights despite not having to wait for any passengers, to avoid the departure slot. If I had a pound for every time someone arbitrarily needed to “see” my boarding pass, without actually viewing it, I could’ve saved the £100 of additional hidden baggage fees. Over £700 pounds to take a small hand luggage each and to have the audacity to want to sit with my partner in the equivalent of a supermarket deck chair. This is not budget. At all. I flew to four destinations in the states last year, totalling six flights and that cost £2k.

Ryanair customer review,Flew Ryanair for the first time 2 weeks ago and again last week. Derry to Birmingham and back. Having read the reviews it was with some trepidation I booked the flights as they are the only airline flying to Derry it was forced on me. The web site wasn't too difficult and I was prompted by online live chat if I dallied they were helpful and reassured me only one booking had been made. Paid for hold luggage as I had a laptop bag as well. Reserved seats were welcome. I printed the boarding passes off before hand and arrived in plenty of time. Onboard reasonable bit garish and the selling wasn't too obnoxious given only a 50 min flight. Depart and arrive on time. So overall the experience wasn't too bad but then everything worked ok. The nagging feeling is what if it hadn't? But given the price you get what you pay for. Would I fly with them again? Given it was the only airline to that airport then yes. If to another airport and there was an alternative and there were consequences to not arriving on time and the company was paying then I would think very hard about it.,5.0,0

No enormous queues anywhere - check-in, boarding/disembarkation and baggage claim were executed super quickly, none of these took more than 10 mins - which is very often a disaster when choosing ""legacy"" airlines. (In addition to that, there were no queues at security control as well at both HHN and VNO - but it's out of airline's responsibility). The cabin crew were polite and helpful, but not annoying - also an excellent job done. And - last but not least - of course, very reasonable fares.

Not the airlines fault and Captain continually updated us. In fact his best update was yet to come. Finally departed bit sooner than originally informed. Inflight service again professional and courteous. Yes, prices can be slightly high, but they are on trains too, but not too over priced, in my opinion. Certainly was no strong selling on this flight. Further delay as we approached Palma, this time due to the weather, but again superbly informed and updated by the pilot, who made sure to tell us we had enough fuel of course. Eventually arrived approximately 1 hour late, into a torrential downpour, thankfully to a stand and not a remote stand with bus trip.

Metro has stopped running, the only way to get into the city centre was via taxi. Since I’m a budget traveler, I didn’t want to waste money on the taxi, so I decided to sleep at the airport and wasted the money for the night of hostel I booked. A day or 2 after, I got an email about flight delays, and only just found out that there was an EU law that any flight delays for 3 hrs and more, the customer is entitled to a claim. I immediately submitted the claim. About a week later, Ryanair rejected my claim, saying my delay was under 3 hrs! Well, the flight was delayed 3 hrs exactly, we didn’t board until 3 hrs later, but it could have landed less than 3 hrs later, which I wouldn’t know, because I didn’t check the exact time I landed, it could be about 2hr 50min later than expected in Sofia. Ryanair also said, any flights that are delayed more than 1.5hr, customers are entitled to claim back expenses during the wait at the airport, providing receipts are provided. At the same time, they closed my case. I took this as a complaint, I asked for the exact time it landed in Sofia; asked for the reason of the delay; explained due to the delay, I lost a night at the hostel, and had to explain to them that I had to sleep at the airport; and why no one informed us there would be spending expenses for delays over 1.5hr?  When I got a reply from Ryanair, the staff was not even answering any of my questions, he just repeated the same thing as the first person said, told me to submit any receipts. Also that the flight was delayed for less than 3 hrs, so I was entitled to the 3hr+ claim. I tried again, explaining this further, but once again, it was no use. They were not doing anything about it. I just wanted to warn anyone flying around Europe, if there’re any delays, make sure you check the time, and make a record of it if possible. You can always get it from the website afterwards and save a record for it, if you need any claims. If it’s delayed for less than 3 hrs, check the airline’s policy and see what you’re entitled to. Because obviously they would not just tell you the freebies you could be entitled to, to save their cost! Anyway, Ryanair service is bad, all the emails I had with them back and forth, they were terrible.

Then today on our flight to Luxembourg we arrived 2 hours before the flight, scanned our passes through security and waited 100 meters from the gate. 30 minutes before the flight we approached the gate. There were no passengers left, only the staff. Then we were told we were two minutes late at the gate and they already deleted us from the passenger list so we won't be able to get on that flight. Staff were very rude and not helpful at all. Never in my life have I experienced such terrible customer service. Usually the boarding doesn't finish up until just before departure! There was no final call announced for the flight, our names were not called! The staff were awful and the only thing they could say was ""you won't get on that plane"". They expect customers to pay all these extras for seating together, cabin luggage, I won't be surprised if they start charging for using a toilet during the flight! But when it comes to be understanding to customers who pay money for the service, they just do not care. I would understand if we had been late and the plane had been starting the engines and preparing for departure, but we could actually see people still entering the plane from the window! So we did not go to our holiday and lost a lot of money. Thank you Ryanair for ruining our holiday! I will never use Ryanair again!",1.0,-1

"""My holiday was ruined by this company""","Definitely my last experience with Ryanair. I had selected MS on the passenger details and was unable to do the check in online due to the fact that the person was 50 years old. I have been told by the customer service team to sort this out at the airport. I had to pay £55 to do the check in at the airport after explaining my case. The customer service team told me in a rude unprofessional way that it was my mistake as I selected MS which means under 16 yo and that’s why I wasn’t unable to do the check in online to a 50 years old woman. Here is the definition of MS in UK: Ms. vs. Miss (and Mrs.) ... Ms. is a title of respect before a woman's name or position that does not indicate her marital status. Miss is title of respect before a woman's name or position that is used when a woman is unmarried (It is often used in reference to a child, teen, or student).

I received a text message Sunday night, after 7PM, saying that if I don’t check in online I could pay up to €110 of fines for my tickets (keep in mind that the ticket was €186). My flight was the next day at 3:30PM. I tried checking in online with the app and website but it kept saying that my reservation number was incorrect. I tried calling that night but their customer service was not open, so I waited until the next morning to call. I called 3 different times that day and waited on hold for costumer service for a total of 65 min and never was able to connect to anyone. Once I arrived at airport, in Bucharest, I spoke to Ryanair sales rep and her manager was treated absolutely terribly. I paid the fine, of course, but the way they treated me and my girlfriend was unacceptable — their rudeness brought my girlfriend to tears. I get hopeless. I knew that I had to check in online, I tried my very best to do it, once I couldn’t I tried very hard to get help from the company but was unsuccessful — the result was €110 fine on €180 ticket.",2.0,-1
"""absolutely horrendous""","Leeds to Majorca. My experience was absolutely horrendous. We paid for fast track from Leeds - Majorca - Valencia - Majorca - Leeds. This was a waste of money as we stood in line which was slower than the normal queue at Leeds Airport. On our way back from Majorca we were seated in the waiting area and approached by one of the staff who demanded to see our boarding pass. We showed her the boarding pass and she immediately demanded that we follow her to the desk. She told my nephew that he had a non-priority ticket and said ""I need your credit card."" When he asked why, she said he had another case and needed to pay £45 now or else he could not fly. She and her colleague seemed to feel proud of the way she had put us on display embarrassing us in front of everyone else who had now lined up behind us. We were being stared at angrily as it seemed we were holding up the queue. I thought I had paid for priority tickets as I paid for fast track and selected seats. I showed them the icon on my Ryanair account after logging in and the responded saying they didn't know what that was. They had to call someone on the phone as my nephew who is American provided an Amex card. They kept us at the desk in front of everyone who thought we were holding up the queue for more than 10 minutes. I asked and they wouldn't give me any more information. Eventually, my nephew got his passport and his boarding pass back and they started embarking. They asked us to wait even though I had paid for fast track and we were already at the front of the queue. They deliberately kept us there and let us board after I became upset. When we boarded we were confronted by the flight attendant who told us that the cabin bag we had just paid for needed to be in the cargo bay even though it's smaller than normal cabin cases. I advised them we had paid and pointed at the tag which was snow taped to the bag and she insisted that we should have been told to put in cargo. I tried to explain that they didn't tell us and we wouldn't know that as we don't work for the airline. She put her hands up in my face cutting me off and stating that its the airport and not the airline and she doesn't work for the airport. I advised that we don't work for the airport either. She agreed for us to have our case in the overhead compartment but stated that should it fill up, it would need to go in the cargo area. We watched as cases bigger and heavier than my nephews were placed in the overhead compartment with no argument. I have never been so embarrassed as I have with Ryanair and will never fly using Ryanair ever again. I will tell anyone who will listen to what happened and never fly Ryanair again. I will happily pay more money to fly with a company with a better reputation. We were deliberately put on display and embarrassed and that is very wrong to do.",3.0,-1

Ryanair customer review,"Like many people on this site we have used Ryanair before like many we abide by their rules don't necessarily like them but we abide by them.

So hold luggage booked priority boarding additional infant equipment all paid for. Flying from Edinburgh to Faro was okay long queues at check-in but okay. Trek at Faro up and down stairs 2 year old and 3 bags not great but can't blame Ryanair (although can't help but think they are treated as 3rd class because of the deals they make with airports). Chaos on way back one person at check-in no priority queue at boarding pass check. Advised it would be at the gate nope people were allowed to stampede if you were already at the back tough! So on return to UK I complained and requested that the priority boarding fee was refunded. Rather than customer service I received a curt ""we do not make refunds"".

In the end the flight cost me as much as full service airline, but I got the worst service. I did not get a glass of water on my international flight with Ryanair.  I emailed them about 15 times before the flight to explain there was a problem with the amount they were charging, which was a totally different amount. To add a bag on the website is supposed to be 45 euros, but they charge 56 euros, I never understood that, and they never answered why. Their replies were nonsense emails not answering my questions.

Ryanair customer review,"I am not a regular user of low cost airlines but on this occasion used Ryanair on due to the holiday destination airport (Chania, Crete). The check-in clerk however could benefit from a refresher course in customer service as he appeared extremely bored and disinterested. However my complaint starts when we did not print off our return boarding passes in advance of the holiday and although we tried to reserve our seats for the return flight, so my family could sit together we were unable to do this via their web-site. We gave up after 2 attempts and assumed we would check-in on arrival and take whatever seats available. We of course were not aware that they would be an additional charge for printing a boarding pass and was advised by the desk clerk to check-in on-line, again we tried to do this via our smart phone but again were unable to access the booking on the web-site. As we had spent a considerable amount of time and with mounting stress from my wife, I was forced to pay the additional charge. The 3 boarding passes were duly hand written in 10 minutes by the Servisair clerk and 135€ extracted. The clerk even told us we were lucky to get the last 3 seats even though we had booked and paid for them. I find these charges levied by Ryanair are totally disproportionate to the administration involved and are punitive in the extreme and are extracted under stressful circumstances. Up to this point we had enjoyed a fabulous holiday only to have it spoiled on our return. I have a number of issues with this penalty charge, firstly; it is not clear on their web-site when making the on-line seat reservations and printing the boarding passes for the outbound flight that you need to make the same arrangements for the return flight (or is it Ryanair’s intention to catch out the new customers?) and secondly, I regularly travel for both business and pleasure with a number of different airlines and have never come across such a policy for boarding passes. I regularly use on-line booking and the barcode via smart phone but generally this is within 24 hours prior to departure and I have never been charged for a boarding pass, this is not the industry norm. I made a complaint to Ryanair and got a stock answer hiding behind the T&C's and no refund. Still valuable albeit expensive lesson learned never to fly Ryanair again.",1.0,-1
"""two trouble free flights""","Beauvais to Bratislava. I had two trouble free flights within last two weeks. The fares were very cheap. I purchased priority boarding, so had 2 cabin bags allowance. Website experience was good, the mobile application worked fine, and apple pay functionality was a big convenience. The only strange thing about website vs application experience is that when purchasing priority boarding you can not buy 10 kg checked bag allowance on the website. On mobile you can do this. Another thing to watch is cost of this service. It changes, and the price can double, so if you need it, it is better to buy it early. At the airport check-in desk was not overcrowded. Boarding was fast and efficient, with usual nasty waiting when priority line had to be formed on the stairs and then lined up near the plane. But flying low cost you have to accept this. Onboard everything was ok. Seats are passably comfortable. I purchased hot meal and it was tasty. Toilet condition was good. Departures and arrivals both times on schedule. I was able to read all the bad reviews, but as I can see most of them are written by the people who didn't follow rules and been fined for that. For me the main difference between legacy carriers and low cost is that legacy bring you to your destination whatever happens (they put you on different flight or on competition company or re-route you). Low cost carriers just say sorry and do refund. This is where the real difference is. All the rest become more and more identical.",10.0,1

No explanation, no intention of helping us store our coats somewhere else. My wife stood up and tried to store the coats somewhere else. This got the staff angry, because they were keen on making up lost time and wanted to depart as soon as possible. They started shouting through the microphone, urging everybody to take their seats and saying that taking your seat is really easy to do. Not only were we denied our minimal confort, decency and respect, but they were now also offending us in public.

When I tried to check-in online, I realized you have to pay for luggage larger than a laptop case. We decided to check-in at the airport in FRA and asked at the counter whether our Ryanair ticket for 225€ really does not include a regular carry-on sized piece of luggage? They told us no and we had to pay 10€ per carry-on luggage/way extra, which means that we paid 40€ for our small, only luggage for the out- & inbound flight additionally. Consequently, our ticket FRA-KRK-FRA added up to a total of 245€ pp. Definitely not a low cost price, but unfortunately, we had no other option. We paid the additional costs without big discussions and received an invoice, clearly stating our names and the amount of 40€ in total for the in- and outbound flight for two. When we were flying back to FRA from KRK, they wanted to charge us again for the exact same carry-on luggage we have already paid for despite showing them the invoice.

We booked a flight in August and the policy about the hand luggage changed in November. We were not able to change our ticket to priority (because that is what you need to do if you want to take your hand luggage with you in the aircraft) so we added the luggage during check-in. This costs us 10 pounds. At the gate we were informed that we had to drop our luggage at the check-in desk (which was not clear at all) so we had to pay an additional 10 pounds to take our luggage in the aircraft. Once in the aircraft we were told that we cannot take our luggage in the aircraft. After explaining everything to 3 different people, they finally let us go and we were able to take our luggage with us. Really Ryanair, just make sure you get your staff trained and don’t change your rules and policies all the time. They will definitly lose a lot of customers. Never in my entire life I will fly Ryanair again. I rather pay 50 pounds extea for better service and clear policies.",1.0,-1
"""€110 for not checking in online""","Barcelona to Cardiff. I have never experienced such a terrible flying experience than I did yesterday, 27th August with Ryanair. Firstly from having to pay €110 for not checking in online. Then greeted at the departure gates at 8:45am and not being allowed to board the plane as the “gates were closed”. We were then told to go to the Ryan Air office and when we asked where it was located we were simply told “downstairs”, no directions or help offered and we were expected to carry all of our luggage back to the very entrance of Barcelona airport. When we got there, there was quite a long queue for the Ryan Air desk. We were told that they couldn’t do anything for us as there were no flights available until the 31st of August which would have meant waiting 4 days due to a strike. Therefore we had to travel to another airport an hour away from there and board another flight with a different airline. We were not offered any compensation and I am disgusted with the service we received and it is safe to say that they have lost our custom as we will never use this airline again. Not only did we lose out on the money we payed for the original flight but also the money we had to pay for the check-in service also. Every member of staff we dealt with from this airline yesterday was extremely rude and all hold terrible customer service skills. Also we were held up by having to pay the check-in fee and issues with the facial recognition machines.",1.0,-1

There can't be many people on this earth who don't know that budget airlines make their profit from quite pricey on-board food.

"""this airline is awful""","I always try to find the cheapest flight to wherever I need to go, and it always ends up being with Ryanair. But I will say, no matter what the price is this airline is awful. The bag requirements for baggage under the seat is way too small. My husband and I have fit numerous “oversized” bags under the seat perfectly fine, but once in a while they will charge us almost €50 for the baggage. That is way over priced for even what the app charges for an extra bag. Also again, it’s ridiculous that I pack super light but they consider my bag too big just because it’s a hiking bag. It’s hard finding other airlines to fly and Ryanair is the most convenient one all the time but man do I hate flying with them. Also the staff when checking into the flight during boarding is always awful and so rude. I feel like they just always want to look for trouble.",1.0,-1
"""Terrible experience today""","Stansted to Rome. Terrible experience today! Not very pleased to say this is not my first with Ryanair. So we book our flight in March for today, 20th April 2019. We checked in yesterday and paid for the selected seats (after already having acquired Priority and 2 Cabin Bags) for 2 travellers. We leave Wales at night and get to the Stansted airport more than 3h prior to departure. The flight was scheduled at 6:25. At 5:10 still nothing is showing on the screens, so I go to the toilet and then we head straight to security. As soon as we get through security we look at the screen again (around 5:40) and the screen says ""Final Call"". Being in a a rush we run through the queues and head to gate 59. When we get there we get told that it's actually gate 91 (other side of the airport) and the lady says ""there's only 2 minutes left, you won't make it"". We ask whether she can make a call to advise we are on our way and this obviously was declined. So we start running again, with backpacks and hold luggages, to get to the right gate. This was very difficult to find and the airport staff we asked weren't that helpful. As expected we don't make it on time. We make our way to the ""Returning Customers"" gates and the airport lady did not even give advise on where to go or what to do, but simply cancelled our boarding passes and wished us a ""lovely weekend"". Lovely Easter weekend: stuck in an airport and our families waiting for us overseas! Ok, so we lose the money paid (around £90) but we don't give up on spending our holidays with our relatives and friends! So we buy the next available flight from Stansted to Rome: 13:25 same day, with Ryanair. We pay the tickets, pay for the 10kg bags and do the check-in straight away. Having travelled with Ryanair for many years I knew that they are able to refund part of the original ticket price (€100 or £79), to use this money towards the cost of the new booking. This is apparently only applicable in certain circumstances, one of which is if you show up at the Ryanair desk not later than 1h after the original departure time. We get into the queue 15/20 min before the deadline and wait for about 30 min, to then be told by the two very unhelpful and disregarded agents (who had not a clue of what this process is), that we had to speak to the Money Exchange team. We leave the queue and wait to speak to this lady who, obviously, said ""I have nothing to do with flights"". Customer Service was terrible to say the least. What happened to the ""Gate Open"" and ""Boarding"" announcements on the screen? Is it a new trend to jump straight to the last call? To cause people stress, sickness, anxiety and everything else that comes with missing a flight, including massive extra financial expenses? Or is this just the way airlines operate today? Playing sick games to ensure people miss flights and spend extra money? Initially I mentioned that this was not my first misfortune with Ryanair: 3 years ago, summer time, my flight was delayed by 3 hours...my solicitors told me that my claim for refund/compensation has been placed on hold due to Ryanair having too many complaints and not dealing with them. We are currently about £300 short due to failure to follow the process on the screen, failing to call our names for the last call (we had priority, there was plenty of time!), plus the hours lost hanging around waiting for another flight.",1.0,-1

I mean this in terms of quality of service, customer care and even cabin crew attitudes. All bottom of the barrel low. Trying to get a refund from Ryanair is a laughable offence. It appears customers are comedians and we are merely entertaining the customer service team requesting a refund. Covid and cancelled flights are no exception in this matter.

Ryanair customer review,I use Ryanair regularly flying from Dublin to the Netherlands. You get what you pay for. Fast boarding a flight with reasonable service and quickly into the terminal once the plane has arrived. The staff aren't particularly friendly and clearly look as if they are under pressure for the entire flight. Upon reaching the gate the flight attendants have often told passengers that they only have 20 minutes to get the plane turned around and to get off quickly once the doors are opened. This often leads to a push when getting off. To avoid this I remain seated until people have started getting off. Because of the short turn around time it isn't unusual to find some else's rubbish in your seat pocket however flight attendants do go round with a rubbish bag before the end of the flight so it's caused by inconsiderate passengers rather than the airline. Overall if you just want to get there on time and you are not concerned about the service fly Ryanair.,5.0,0

Take note of checking in online prior to your flight else you have to pay an arm an leg to get your boarding pass printed at the check in counter, which was expected of a normal airline check in. To make the situation worse, the 45 euro / pax penalty was not stated during the purchasing process or on our etickets. After queuing for almost an hour at the check in line of Ryanair,  we were slapped in the face by an impatient check in officer who just rolled her eyes and  said that 'sorry the online check in just ckosed 2mins ago'. And rudely shooed us to the other counter to make payment as she hurried to attend another customer. She said no payment, no boarding, and just shrugged her shoulders. To rub salt in the wound, We were told we could have checked in while waiting in the queue. How would we have known when there was no signage whatsoever while we were queuing. At the 'payment counter' there was another 20 mins queue with more than 30 other passengers paying their penalty. What a great way to easily earn a few thousand extra euro per flight.

The flight was rescheduled to 12 midnight, but it eventually only took off at around 1am the next day - a total of seven hours of delay. 2) Zero accountability. Ground staff were completely clueless as to any protocol in times of delay. Worse still, for the next ninety minutes or so there was no follow up action and all passengers were just stranded at the boarding gate. We were told to ""come check back every 30 min or so"" and there was no assurance of what would be done. 3) Shamelessly tried to shirk responsibility. We were told we could make claims via the EU261 flight regulation. However when I submitted my claim, the airline had the gall to say the flight was ""delayed due to air traffic controller restrictions, which was outside of our control"", which was totally opposite of the technical errors that the air crew had stated. 4) Poorest ever customer service. I followed up with Ryanair customer service staff who had zero professionalism. He was nonchalant throughout the correspondence. The incompetence of this staff member is highlighted in the fact he redirected me to the CAA UK site despite knowing my flight had departed from Spain, and that CAA does not serve cases where the flight departs from other EU member countries. Overall, I regret booking flights from a subpar company with service undeserving of any approval whatsoever. The rock-bottom standard is paralleled by its consistently plummeting stock price.

Ryanair customer review,BCN to STN return. I used to dread flying on Ryanair though in practice I had very little choice. The last year has seen a major improvement as a result of their charm offensive. Gone are the rugby scrums to get the best seats the petty case weighing and the inflexible enforcement of rules. Most of the recent flights I've been on (these two included) have been pretty full but there's been the opportunity to move to a less crowded section in spite of the usual 'not allowed due to weight and balance of the aircraft' nonsense trotted out by the purser at the start of the flight. I was surprised on the outbound sector that they used the jet way piers at BCN thereby loading from only the front door and rendering the boarding process rather chaotic and long-winded. First time I've ever seen this on a FR flight and you can see why they prefer a front and rear door approach. As always both flights were on time and it may just be that I've become immune to them but the intrusive sales related tannoy babble during the flight does seem to have been cut back. As others have said if you stay within their rules flying Ryanair can be reasonably pleasant these days. May it long continue.,8.0,1
"""Nightmare Experience with Ryanair Crew""","My recent flight with Ryanair from Lisbon to Stansted turned into a nightmare due to the behavior of two specific crew members. Their actions made the journey highly inconvenient for my family and several other passengers. It seemed their main objective was to extract extra money from travelers for baggage, which created a tense and unpleasant atmosphere during boarding. The trouble began when a passenger in front of us was forced to pay for their bag, even though it appeared perfectly fine from our viewpoint. We voiced our concerns, hoping for some empathy from the crew member. Unfortunately, this only seemed to provoke them to target us next. On a hot day in Lisbon, we had placed our jackets in a foldable bag, adhering to the baggage policy. However, as we were being briefed on the rules, we put our jackets on. After a discussion with a colleague, the crew member allowed us to proceed. While in the queue, one of my daughters, who has asthma, removed her jacket and hat. Suddenly, the same crew member appeared, ordering us out of the line and threatening to deny us boarding. Despite explaining that nothing had changed since they had previously allowed us through, they remained stubborn. They called another crew member over, and both of them joined in a verbal assault. They disregarded the fact that the extra bags were gadgets belonging to my child and wife, insisting that we could only carry four bags. Their behavior was not only rude and disrespectful but also unprofessional, displaying personal animosity and complete disregard for our well-being. It was evident that this crew member was actively seeking an excuse to single us out and personally target us. Our attempts to explain were met with increasing firmness, dismissiveness, and even mockery. Their conduct left a lasting negative impression, overshadowing what should have been a smooth and stress-free journey. I am deeply disappointed that Ryanair employs individuals who lack professionalism and take their frustrations out on innocent customers. This experience was disheartening, leading me to question whether I would choose to fly with Ryanair in the future. The treatment we received was unacceptable, and I sincerely hope that the airline takes this feedback seriously and addresses the conduct of its crew members.",1.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,Regularly fly with Ryanair from Dublin to France and it works wonderfully. Listen to a lot of people complaining about the airline and really cannot understand why. Staff are usually pleasant although there is always the exception to the rule. It's always on time boarding and exiting is always efficient. Without this airline we and many others could not fly as often.,10.0,1
"""You get what you pay for""","You get what you pay for. We paid 85 euros for a Hamburg to Lisbon (round trip) plus 10 euros for a seat Reservation, which is just ridiculously cheap. One thing that I did not like - and which I haven't experienced when flying Ryanair before - is that the system for the online check-in is splitting up Groups on purpose to make you pay for a reserved seat. However, 5 euros are okay for a seat reservation. The 737-800 was quite new, seats are as usually not too comfortable and food and drinks were not included - which I am not expecting when I am paying such a low fare as I did. Both flights were more or less on time.",5.0,1
"""trying to rip you off""","I have just tried to check in on line for a forthcoming trip to Milan with Ryanair, having had the debacle of trying to sit together with friends -  this is just not possible unless you pay extra up front again!! Thought I had solved the problem by paying an additional £6 PP Per flight for priority boarding. Only to discover that due again to their policy change this no longer includes early check in. The only way to sit together is to reserve your seats. Which is also a cheaper option than priority boarding but it doesn't tell you this when you make the booking. It is also not possible to change your Priority boarding to reserving a seat! The other point worth mentioning is that when you do book in the 4 day period before you fly, the Ryanair system seems to be designed to ensure that you are as far apart from your family as possible, which causes chaos at boarding as everyone then boards the flight and tries to sit with their family. If I have a choice Ryanair will be my last choice of carrier. No longer the cheap option they once were - they give you the distinct feeling they are trying to rip you off. Most certainly the worst of the cheap airlines! I will not use them again unless there is no other option - even if I have to pay more for the flight. Don't try to complain on the phone - they have no complaints department, just someone who keeps on telling you their policy has changed and to look at their website if you want to complain.",1.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,First time with Ryanair flying Stansted to Prague. Good price more competitively priced now than Easyjet hence deciding to travel with them instead. Flight left a little late but made up for the delay in the air and landed on time. Cabin basic and not particularly clean- we literally passed the departing passengers from our plane across the tarmac so obviously no time there to clean the plane - however if speedy turnaround keeps costs down I can put up with a few crumbs. Did not pay for allocated seating but got two decent seats one by the window. If they reduced allocated seating costs I might have considered it. Return flight also bang on time leaving and arrived early. Pilots friendly and informative although very difficult to hear as engines seemed much noisier than other airlines. Staff were definitely not as friendly as other airlines rolling eyes at passengers etc which is a shame as being cheap shouldn't mean poorer customer service. I am meticulous about measuring hand luggage as I do not want to be charged extra but the shapes and sizes of bags being allowed on was hilarious- some people looked like they'd packed for a 3 week cruise. Everything was allowed on and massive bags which would never have fitted in the cabin were allowed in the hold free of charge. Overhead lockers were completely crammed with massive hand luggage items. All in all does what it says on the tin - got us there and back alive and well on time at a good price.,8.0,1

Efficient cabin crew, great value fare. If you remember that Ryanair is basically a bus with wings, you'll never be disappointed.",10.0,1

For a short trip such lost time means a lot. Staff on boarding was so rude and does not treat passengers with respect. Seats were too small and no space for legs.

"""My experience with Ryanair this February was appalling""","Even bearing in mind that this is a low cost airline, there are things that should not be tolerated. The agents at check-in counters were outright abusive. One of them, looked at my passport, saw Ukrainian nationality in it and asked for a Covid test. I was fully vaccinated and at this time the requirements on Ryanair website was either full vaccination or a test. I showed all my proofs of vaccination and a self-test, but she kept demanding that I do a test at the airport worth GBP 40. I pointed out the requirements on the website were different and then she said “one more comment and you are not flying”. I took the test, spent money and 90 minutes waiting for the results, and returned to the check-in. By then there was another agent at the counter, she said I didn’t need the test and proof of full vaccination would do. I returned to speak to the first staff member, but she yelled at me in front of other customers calling me rude and saying that she refuses to “serve me” in any circumstances. I contacted Ryanair multiple times after, bringing this situation to their attention, they did not answer. My experience with Ryanair this February was appalling, and I recommend to avoid flying with this airline at all costs.",1.0,-1

It is virtually impossible to find a customer service email contact. My query is very simple but, as per, large companies such as Ryanair have no concept of customer service. On top of that, they appear to be advertising a service of live chat which does not actually exist!

"""very disappointing experience""","Manchester to Faro, and a very disappointing experience. I booked in July for a holiday to Faro in December, party of 4, of which 3 are disabled, 2 of which needed to use the abulift to access the aircraft. I booked special assistance at the time of booking and was allocated specific seats for out party to be able to access easily. We all booked in and went to special assistance area. All fine and good! Well apart from the huge queue that most people with limited diablilities could never stand in to go to bag drop. Flight called, we were taken to board the plane. Wait theres a massive problem, theres 6 people who have disabilities and need the abulift, but we were told Ryanair would only take 4! It seemed 2 others hadn't pre booked assistance but were allocated to board on the abulift. 2 of us in wheelchairs in my party were left on the tarmac whilst the special assistance and Ryanair argued about the fact the pilot wouldn't take more than 4! We got as far as the tarmac, sat for 10 minutes in the freezing cold wind whilst they tried to say we couldnt board. We were totally humiliated asked if we really needed to use the abulift and asked to prove wed booked special assistance, thankfully I always keep the paperwork safe. No other disabled passengers who were elderly were asked. It seems if you are young you can be challenged whether or not you actually need the help.  Ryanair staff would not help and it took one of the special assistance staff to say how ridiculous and bad the situation was, for us to actually get on the plane. We were told shortly before we may not be able to fly as its Ryanair policy that they only take 4 disabled people who cant climb the aircraft stairs. Maybe when Ryanair take your money they should let you know this. 4 people on a whole flight is beyond ridiculous, it does not take into consideration that most people with mobility problems or chronic illness would find it very difficult to climb steps and carry a hand luggage bag, forget those who are confined to a chair. As a result I'd never fly with them again. I was made to feel like a nuisance.",1.0,-1
"""delayed sat on the plane for 2.55h""","Ancona to Stansted. We got delayed and sat on the plane for 2.55hrs. No refreshments have been offered or any form of compensation.

Not even a monitor in the middle of aisle to view the GPS. Be careful on their website, before you actually pay for your ticket, they try to sell you extra things, make sure you select “no thanks” if they are not for you. If you buy 2 tickets at the same time, you dont get seats together, you have to pay extra for that. The only way we’ll be using this company again is if there is absolutely no other flight available, i’d rather pay a little extra for a better service and a more comfortable flight.",2.0,-1

I then removed a large duvet cover from my bag, after which the bag fit into their standard model box. Still, they ignored it, and repeated: pay or be left behind.

They are the number one airline in my opinion for selling you exactly what you want, in terms of priority boarding, priority seats, luggage options, etc. If you want something, you can pay for it. If you don't want something, don't pay for it. Simple enough. You can check in weeks before your flight, which means that you can print out both boarding passes at home. A lot more reasonable than airlines that make you wait until 24 hours before the flight (why?!) Most of the people I hear complaining about Ryanair don't follow the rules and then blame the airline for their own mistakes or oversights.

"""Very easy and no hassle""","Dusseldorf to Marrakesh. A flawless flight with Ryanair, which started at convenient and small Airport Weeze. Annoying waiting outside in the cold before boarding, but I can understand why: FR's middle name is efficiency, so it's better to have all passengers lined up in front of the plane. We had two pieces of hand luggage and were on seats 1A and 1B which was great. Miles of legroom and no-one besides us. Plane departed on time but had to make a detour because of a strike in Belgium. Therefore flight took a little over 4 hours but not the airline's fault. Nice crew which made two rounds with reasonably priced food and drinks. Inbound flight equal: on time and comfortable because of seats at the emergency seat, which is well worth the euros on a 3,5 hrs long flight. People who are complaining that FR is not clear about the obligation to print the boarding pass are wrong: they make that very clear. Not able to print?

Ryanair customer review,Flew Manchester-Gran Canaria. Good flight times and got baggage quickly. Attempting to print off the boarding pass scam was painful to say the least. In the UK the site kept crashing and took the best part of a day to achieve the process only to have to repeat this in our holiday destination. When at Manchester airport it was displayed that boarding for our flight was in 5 minutes this continued for about 25 minutes with no updates. We were then requested to proceed to boarding that I can only explain as a cattle market. We were then left to wait in the queue for the best part of another 45 minutes. Consequently our flight was delayed by well over an hour with no explanation or apology. Whilst on the flight to Gran Canaria the seat belt sign light was displayed intermittently for long periods with no evidence of turbulence or explanation. Being 2 adults we could manage this but we had to feel for the passengers with young children who desperately wanted the toilet. Baggage - the allowance is 15 kilos for hold luggage and 10 for hand luggage. When we flew out from Manchester they counted hand luggage in our allowance. On return from Gran Canaria they decided that hold luggage should only be 15 kilos. Our hold luggage weighed exactly the same as it did at Manchester and we did not have hand luggage but were told that it would cost us 70 euros to pay the excess. Having very little hand luggage facilities available we had to empty our case to avoid the excess charge. Admittedly we should have read the small print but one would question why this was not highlighted in Manchester and came to light in Gran Canaria on our return. Overall it may be a budget airline but really not worth the hassle.,1.0,-1

Was very pleasant. However had I have been charged then I would have paid since I know the luggage limit - as does everyone else. Flight said delayed by 50 mins. But then suddenly that was taken away & we were no longer delayed. Took us by surprise we had to dash to the gate. Didn’t weigh my hand luggage which was allowed to 10kg but it was actually about 15kg. Which I would have sucked up and paid had they weighed and told me. Since it’s my problem not there’s. They lay it out very clearly what the limit is so I don’t know why people complain at being charged extra. Flight arrived in Aarhus on time after taking off ontime. Bags were on the belt  after passport control. Flight coming in was very very bumpy due to the weather but the pilot did very well to land so smooth. Flight home from Aarhus was again on time and actually arrived about 25 mins early. So we must have had good wind on our side. The leg room is minute. I am 5’7 and pretty chubby & it was a struggle for my legs. My knees got bashed every time the person in front moved. The seats are ok, since Ryanair are a short haul company no one is going to break their backs on the seats. Friendly staff and a good clean cabin. Not dated like some airlines. I am terrified of flying but felt no more unsafe with them than I do with everyone else.  My flight was about £25 return and baggage was £30 each way - similar for all baggage costs.

"""Don't fly Ryanair""","Flew Ryanair from Birmingham to Dublin in September 2015, flew Business Plus and paid a premium for priority checkin for exit row seats.

They wouldn't print the boarding passes until the charged was made to my credit card. We then had to have the seats allocated, at which stage they allocated the same seat to my wife and myself, when we queried, she is no, at which time we advised her to look at the boarding passes, and then she reallocated the seating. On arrival at the gate, we waited in queue under a glass roof which was more like a hothouse, they then open another queue allowing other passengers to board the aircraft, leaving those that had paid the additional fee to wait. It wasn't until the priority boarding queue starting to voice their thoughts that they stopped the other queue boarding. Once onboard, the aircraft seems to be out of the dark ages, excessively old compared to Australian budget airlines. Seats are very narrow and uncomfortable. On seeking a refund for the 135.00, they confirmed the fee was charged incorrectly and would refund. However they wouldn't refund to my credit card, that I would have to wait 3-4 weeks and receive the payment by cheque.

I suppose not their fault but instead of asking passengers who wanted to go to Manchester to go to one desk and the others at another desk I was told ""first come first served"".

"""horrible customer service""","Hamburg to Dublin. I fly with Ryanair once or twice a week over 40 weeks of the year. Going forward from my experience today only because they are cheap. And they are a horribly cheap airline with an absolutely horrible customer service. I had a problem checking in via their on line app this afternoon. As a result I ran past their check in deadline time. I rang their service team who told me to go to their service desk at Hamburg. Long story short they charged my €55 to check in. I now know their charges on late check in but there was absolutely no empathy for my issue. No flexibility and couldn’t care less. It was about getting money from me. I had another occasion to contact their customer service team to get back an iPad that I left on their plane. Again absolutely useless in either their knowledge of how to help me and they didn’t care. Luckily I was able to get the iPad back due to the find my phone app. I will fly with them only (and only) because they are cheap. So I will use them the way they use their customers. I predict the unions will create a situation where Ryanair will end up having to charge the same as much better and reputable airlines like Aer Lingus (an absolute pleasure to fly with) and then Ryanair will not last. Zero out of ten for me. If I could give a minus number I would for their customer service and for senior management for putting greedy, non caring and ignorant process and policies in place.",1.0,-1

"""would not reimburse us""","Berlin to Stansted. We purchased Ryan Air tickets for this leg of our flight because they had the best price. We bought the tickets several months in advance. Forty-eight hours before the flight I got an email saying that we had to pre-check-in to avoid a 50 Euro additional charge. I used my cell phone to go online and do this, but when I got to the website I went as far as I could with the pre-check-in and thought it was done. I clicked on every button that seemed to advance me to the next part and then came to the end. When we got in line to check in we were told to go to another line where we learned that the pre-check-in never went through, so we had to pay an additional 50 Euros for each ticket. There were also others in the same line who had the same experience. When we finished the trip I wrote to Ryan Air about it and got back a curt letter saying there was nothing wrong with their website, and that they would not reimburse us. I think this is just a super-sneaky way of getting more money out of some customers. So beware!",1.0,-1

After check in we had to fight and push our way through a grid lock for security , then ran like mad people through the crowd just making the aircraft before gates closed. I have never experienced anything lie it before. After paying for baggage, I think British Airways would have been cheaper, considering had to make our way to and from Stanstead as well.",2.0,-1
"""you cannot have high expectations""",Ryanair provided exactly what I was expecting for the price paid flying from London to Cologne. Check in was fine as this is done via their app but boarding was late as always and the ground staff predictable indifferent. Once on board the seats were bearable with only a small amount of leg room. If I were over 6ft then it would be uncomfortable. Cabin crew are okay but spend the most part finding places for people's bags as they continually fail to impose size or weight restriction at the gate given the bags people bring on board. The flight was late arriving but nothing to severe and disembarking was a breeze with front ant back doors used. Overall you cannot have high expectations for the price and Ryanair are a decent choice for any flight sub 2 hours.,6.0,1
"""will try to avoid them at all costs ""","Have flown with Ryanair a few times at this stage and from now onwards will try to avoid them at all costs as they are probably the worst airline after United. They come across as a low cost airline but they make up for it in as many ways as possible. If you want checked baggage it is an addition a fee of approx €35 each way for a 15kg bag! If you don't have a boarding pass before arriving to the airport they will charge €50 to print each one and their latest trick is to try and get people to pay for their desired seat allocation. If you don't want to pay for your seat allocation they will purposely split you up, myself and my partner were about 10 rows apart on our way to Palermo and back from Dublin. We know there were many others in the same situation including families with children. On my return flight I even had a free seat next to me.

My nerves were in shreds, thinking I was over allowance etc. (I wasn't). I saw people with three and even four carry-on bags.

Ryanair customer review,I have just flown from Dublin to Manchester. It was my first time flying with Ryanair and I really wasn't looking forward to the flight as I have heard many extremely bad reviews. The flight in all honestly was not a bad flight we arrived 15 minutes early into Manchester and I have no complaints regarding the crew on board they were pleasant and polite. This company have a terrible reputation for trying to get money any which way they can however if you read the terms and conditions properly there should be no reason for you to part with your hard earned cash. The seat pitch was fine for me a female at 5ft 4 inches and for the 45 minute duration but I can imagine it must be extremely uncomfortable for men as I can imagine if you tall it would be awful for those longer flights. One thing which I really didn't like was the non-existent seat allocation. I felt as if I was part of a cattle herd trying to get on board as people had started to queue an hour before we were due to depart to ensure families got seats together. Ryanair overall is not terrible you get what you pay for. They are a budget no frills airline and I think people tend to forget about that. There is no inflight entertainment not even an inflight magazine people who expect these things really need to remember how much they paid for the flight. I will fly again if they are the cheapest option.,5.0,1

I failed to do it online and went to the kiosks. There were 4 of them, 2 would not work, one was working badly and the 4th worked ok. It cost me the £45. If I had known about this charge and the problems involved earlier, I could have done it online at my hotel, but Ryanair would not get their silly hidden charge of £45, which made the flight dearer than Air Lingus, who did not have any charge for this the last time I flew with them. I will never travel with Ryanair again over this. I expect the cost paid before the flight to be final.",2.0,-1
Ryanair customer review,Day trip to Bremen 10th December from Stansted. As ever Ryanair was punctual and efficient. It is a flying bus from A to B. There is no ceremony involved. Ryanair has a couple of simple rules about baggage and to have your boarding pass before you arrive. If you can't arrange something as simple as printing out a piece of paper and complain that you have to pay for luggage on top of your massively cheap air ticket to begin with then just don't fly with these people. I'm off to Morocco next from Stansted for less than £70 return. One small backpack well within the limits with a few pairs of jeans and some T-shirts rolled up neatly folded up colour printed boarding passes and remembering to sit on the right hand side of the aircraft to avoid the sun blazing through the window for the morning flight.,10.0,1
Ryanair customer review,Recently I travelled to Barcelona with British Airways. Have used Ryanair on a number of occasions so I was interested to compare the two. Can't wait to get back to Ryanair. On British Airways the food was rubbish the seat were uncomfortable and cramped and the staff were uninterested in no one but the first class passengers. At least I know when I fly with Ryanair the plane will be new and clean and the seats are comfortable. The food is acceptable and worth the money. They are nearly always on time. Flying with Ryanair is not a problem so long as you stick to the rules. Read everything on the booking form. The last two return flights to Spain cost me £89 including one piece of hold luggage.,10.0,1
"""superior couldn’t care less attitude""","For some ridiculous reason, using Ryanair online check-in which is mandatory, you need to re-enter all passport info again into the same system that already stored it when tickets were purchased. I again entered all info for our family of 8 and the website timed me out. I tried again, saving the info as I went along but their system does not allow saves. Again, timed out with an ‘error’ page. At check in we explained to a Ryanair agent what happened. She rudely told us this was not their problem and we had to pay extra. We were sent to pay for one bag and a check-in fee, amounting to $630Cdn, more than the price of 8 flights! We were told if we prove an ‘error’ page on the computer they would refund. We showed them the error page. They wouldn’t accept it there and forced us to pay up front then call customer service for a refund. We did, and received a stock email and refused us a refund. Everyone we dealt with had a superior couldn’t care less attitude. They lied about a refund being possible. As a business owner, this kind of service appalls me. This whole episode left a bad taste in our mouth and coloured our first trip to Ireland. We will never fly Ryanair again.",1.0,-1
"""not customer friendly actions""","Stansted to Lanzarote. Their random seating option that ensures that 2 people never sit together unless they pay and choose for their seat has to be one of the most selfish and not customer friendly actions of all.

Ryanair customer review,My husband and I fly Ryanair about 4 times a year we have no problems with them at all. Providing you know the t&cs and abide by them. People who moan about boarding pass issues mostly only have themselves to blame. As to people who moan about the on time fanfare they really need to get a grip it last about two seconds live with it! In February we were unable to land at East Midlands because of high winds and were diverted to Birmingham. We found Ryanair to be very organised coaches waiting and back to East Midlands in no time. I do admit that the new timings regarding printing of boarding passes is a pain but for goodness sake pay an extra £10 and print your return passes before you go away.,9.0,1

Usual melee on board, staff pressuring people to buy rubbish food, drinks, duty free goods and lottery tickets (and complaining loudly to each other when failing to do so!) Big problem when we came in to land at Chania airport. Pilot failed on first attempt - think he was travelling far too fast for runway - and despite perfect weather conditions, we had to climb again and were then an extra 20 mins in sky and ten mins landing. No explanation given by crew, lots of people worried in case it was a pervasive mechanical problem (unable to drop landing gear for example) or just a careless pilot - neither are happy thoughts to have as you circle your destination! So no phoney, fixed ""on time landing"" song to endure, but no apology or explanation either.

Ryanair customer review,I have flown Ryanair many times over the last few years and never really had a bad experience though it was clear they were pushing the low cost model to extremes. My most recent trip was the first since their change of direction and things have improved: best is reserved seats which makes boarding much more civilised the selling of food and other items seems lower key and the 'another on-time arrival' jingle is less irritating than it was - though I could still live without it. It is still a fairly basic service but not too dissimilar from that offered by other carriers on intra-European routes. Ryanair finally seems to be aware of what attracts customers apart from low fares and is addressing some of the issues I hope it continues.,7.0,1

Ryanair customer review,I fly Ryanair and easyjet to Malaga from Liverpool every 2 weeks and have done so for 2.5 years. The service from both is good and Ryanair are normally the cheapest. I have had 3 delays due to weather and one diversion to East Midlands last year due to the weather. I do hear complaints every now and then on flights for both airlines the majority by people who are not seasoned travellers and only fly on limited occasions. The complaints were mostly why cant I sit at the front because they see these seats are free but they are told you cant have these seats as the aircraft needs to be balanced. Most accept this others don't and they hold the queue up by arguing. Then you get the guy and his mate who hover around the extra leg room seats to see if they can get one and they block the aisles and hold the queue up. Now that allocated seating is on all aircraft these problems seem to be resolved apart from the odd idiot who says I want to sit next to my mate but we did not get that option when we booked so can you sort it this again holds the queue up. With regards to the aircraft staff yes they have their bad days but that is not surprising as they see the same type of idiots flying in and flying out. The expression you pay peanuts you get monkeys however does not apply to the majority of staff I have come across and the vast majority of regular travellers appreciate the stewards and the service they give. If you wish for a better service then dig deep and save up for the next ten years and you can fly business class.,10.0,-1

The other rip off is the fee if you forget to check in within 2hrs of your flight. I have used Ryanair all my life, to regularly visit family in Ireland, and go to destinations in Europe, regularly noting their desperate and greedy attempts to extort more money from their customers/captive audience for things that were previously included within the ticket price.

"""very pleasant staff""","Flew Birmingham to Dublin with Ryanair, have never been on one of these flights that hasn't been at least 90% full, this time around 50% as extra flights had been laid on for Cheltenham and this was one of the flights going back to Dublin near empty which made for a very relaxing experience. I fly this route several times a month and usually default to Aer Lingus as they can be cheaper if planned and booked in advance. This time fares on both airlines were exorbitant thanks to St Patrick's Day and the Cheltenham Festival and Ryanair came out cheaper. Brand new 737 with new interior and the very pleasant staff resplendent in their new uniforms. After a very stressful journey to the airport it was lovely to be greeted by such friendly staff, relaxing interior, comfortable seat (I had paid for exit seat for extra leg room so can't comment on the regular seats) and lovely relaxing music. It all felt surreal because our go-to response to anything Ryanair has usually always been negative but this looks like it's set to change. A few years ago, when I had taken my first Ryanair flight in many years I actually laughed at the state of the garish interior but not any more. Why ever did Ryanair not make these changes years ago, I imagine they are going to elicit quite the competitive response from competitors and not just from the no-frills market either. One comment I would always have to make about Ryanair is that although they can be categorised as 'no frills', the same can't be said about being a 'low fares' airline as some of the fares, particularly on this busy route can sometimes resemble long-haul fares. Apart from that, well done Ryanair and please keep up the relaxing music on boarding and disembarkation which is a really nice touch.",9.0,1

Ryanair customer review,East Midlands to Faro and return. Have flown many times with Ryanair both on business and for leisure. Only ever had one serious delay. Both flights were ok. Return flight delayed by 10 minutes with limited catering due to knock on effect of strike in France. Staff apologised for this with clear explanation as to reason. Staff on both flights very pleasant. British Airways should teach their business class stewards to give a genuine smile like this. With regards to complaints about add on charges.

Fortunately for me I left 4 hours exchange time, so this reduced to just 2 hours to get from Ciampino (Rome aiport) to Tiburtina (bus station). Still it caused some stress, because in case of a higher delay I would have lost my connection and had to pay an extra 200 euros to buy a train ticket later on that day.
