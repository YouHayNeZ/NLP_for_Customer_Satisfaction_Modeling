Flew back from Faro to London Luton Friday 2nd February. Ryanair in both directions was bang on time and smooth flights in both directions.  We always sit in Front for more space and this was very comfortable for just under a 3 hour flight. The cabin crew were polite and efficient with nice sense of humour especially and engagement especially Ethan and his female colleague at the front section. For their human touch [unlike sometimes the stand offish BA crews] merit a 10/10 marking,1,1.0
"Another good affordable flight with Ryanair. On time, pleasant staff at check-in and on board. We use Ryanair as our first choice on every flight we take.",1,1.0
"Really impressed! You get what you pay for, this flight only cost £19.99. The seats were soft, and there was tons of legroom! (not in an emergency exit) The cabin was spotless. The colours were a little bright but it was good. Cheap and no frills! Highly recommend, flies almost everywhere,",1,1.0
"I should like to review my flight from Faro to Liverpool with Ryanair. I booked the seat with Ryanair several months before my planned travel and found the website clear and easy to use. Ryanair sent quite frequent emails relating to the flight and attempted to sell me extras. The check-in procedure was followed by a bag-drop at Faro Airport. This was not efficient and the app they recommended for speedy bag-drop did not work. Setting that aside, I was able to check-in my bag within less than 30 minutes of having arrived at the airport. Boarding was supposedly via group but this did not materialise at all. The cabin crew had a reasonable presence and delivered a serious safety procedure. During the flight the crew worked hard and had several rounds of drinks for sale. I found the seat suitable for a flight just under 3 hours. The flight departed on-time and arrived on schedule too. Disembarkation was delayed in Liverpool while this was not the fault of Ryanair, there was no communication with the passengers as to why this was the case. Disembarkation was not orderly and was poorly managed. Overall, a decent offering from Ryanair.",1,0.9690330676928018
"Flight left the gate ahead of schedule, fare was really cheap and cabin crew were welcoming and friendly. Flight was so much cheaper than Aer Lingus and flying with Ryanair is a much better experience.",1,1.0
"Booked a fight from Copenhagen to Poland though booking.com Somewhere in the email from booking.com it states that checkin must be done online from home. I figure I'll do it in the morning since I have plenty of time. it's low season and I don't have any checked in luggage. I live in Copenhagen not far from the airport. Morning comes and I try to check in online. No luck, apparently they close online checkin 3 hours before the flight. I figure I'll just check in at the airport at those self serve terminals. I arrive at the airport 2 hours before my flight and head for a terminal. Prompt says: kindly go to service desk. Head for service desk. They charge me 42 euro to check me in. The flight itself was 57 euro. They almost charged me the price of the flight just to check me in manually! And they forced me to check in manually by closing online and self-serve checkin. This is Ryanair policy. Apparently. Wizzair and booking are not without blame either, as they decide who they want to do business with.",0,1.0
"The flight itself is operated by Malta air and I've always found their cabin crew to be very pleasant and respectful. That however cannot be said for their handling agents either in Pisa or Stansted. The Stansted bunch I have found to be rude, argumentative and hostile. Like they hate their work. Boarding no matter where is a shambles. You're invariably stuck in a freezing cold or roasting hot stairwell even before your aircraft reaches the gate. It's not a pleasant experience. Nowhere to sit. As budget airlines don't use jetties at the gate there is every chance that you're gonna get soaked going to and from the terminal in winter. Cabins are not the worst that I've been on. I'm a wee guy so 2hrs 30mins isn't too bad. As far as cheap fares go, I've yet to get a Ryaniar flight that I found to be value for money. All I can say about the flights is that they are generally uneventful and again the Malta Air crew are welcoming. I found that once you add on all of their ridiculous charges they are really not better value than companies like British Airways. It is worth remembering that whether you like Ryanair or not it gives us a choice.",1,0.9519226416525882
"Staff is rude and has no manners, let alone be professional. I had a backpack with which I flew from Vienna to Paris through Ryanair without any issues. But while flying from Paris to Barcelona, they asked me to pay for the backpack. They have kept a small rack to check size of your carryon baggage, which is way smaller than the one we have in flight and as a result, high chances you will always end up paying. Because of this there was a long queue and one couple even missed their flight and instead of being considerate, they smiled and asked them to purchase ticket for another flight.",0,1.0
"Ryanair ground service staff is really bad. If you have a problem, they never listen and they never help. I had problems twice. I tried to explain my situation. They did not listen and they did not take me to the flight. I missed the flight because of their mistake. They did not even look at the evidence that I tried to show them. My family holiday became a tragedy.",0,1.0
"I wanted to check in online a night before our flight, but my nationality was not listed in their websites and when we wanted to check in in person they asked for a fee, and that still was not a problem! They asked for a credit card to check for late check-in fee, we asked them to pay by our debit card or by cash, but they did not accept it. So we missed our flight, and they made us pay a No show fee on the application so that they give us another flight in the evening. The flight we got was about 30 Euro and the no show fee we paid was 100 Euro. When I told them in Germany we can pay by debit card or cash, they said we are an Irish airline it has nothing to do with Germany! Then why do you have your business here? The other thing is when I mentioned my nationality was not listed on your website they did not accept that and they inserted my nationality manually!",0,1.0
"Krakow to Tirana with Ryanair's subsidiary, Buzz, on a brand new Boeing 737Max-200. Flight departed early and arrived before schedule. Crew extremely well presented and professional. Ryanair does not have the most comfortable seats, and leg room is not the best, however for a 1 hour 25 minute flight I do not have much complaints. If you follow their baggage rules and basic online check-in, you won't have any issues. While they are the low cost airline I fly least in comparison to WizzAir/easyJet, I would willingly fly them again if given the opportunity.",1,0.9364462144163881
"This airline charges you for almost every thing. Every child needs to be seated with an adult. Got it, it is for Safety. But you must pay for the seat selection of the accompanying adult so that you can choose the seat next to the child. Only allowed a bag pack to be carried on for free, ay other cabin bag you must pay. You pay if you don’t check in online. It’s €55 to check in at the airport. That’s more than twice of my ticket price. No room for any negotiation. By the way, even if the flight is delayed and you have time to do online check in for free, too bad, just pay.  They insisted that we have an email to inform us of this. Too bad if you ignored the email.",0,1.0
At least 5 passengers denied boarding in Lisbon due to overbooking. In London Stansted the plane was 1:30 minutes late due to what seemed to be defrosting.,0,1.0
"This is my tenth flight with Ryanair this year - and eight of the 10 flights had delays - usually between one and two hours, but we had more than three hours too! There is basically no way anymore that you can convincingly plan longer trips with them, for example a train journey after arrival, because you never know when you arrive. Today, we are loosing another train ticket that we bought ages ago in advance, when we still believed that some delays are exceptions to the rule, rather than the new rule. Even back then, we already calculated with a one and a half hour Ryanair delay, but that is just not good enough for that ""never on time airline"". To make things worse, according to EU law, they only have to pay compensation from a three hour delay, i.e. most delays go without any sanction, meaning a contribution from Ryanair for the additional expenses their customer have to pay. Long live neoliberalism? Add to that the non-existing Ryanair customer-sevice, which leaves you in the dark about new departure time, gate changes etc, and you have the worst package you can possibly buy. What can we customers do about it? At first, let us please stop buying drinks, food and other items on flights that come with more than half an hour delay. We should not reward such an airline for what they do to us. And then better check always the prices of competitors: Eurowings, EasyJet, Vuelin, Wizzair, anything that stays within a reasonable price for the package might be worth considering.",0,1.0
"We have a return flight from Gatwick to Alicante. The issue started with online check-in. The application has constantly faild. At the end we make the registration front London to Alicante it was takes a lot of time. Even with this registration we cannot get boarding pass and gave to go to the desk. On the way came back we tried to make check-in online but it always faild. We have to go to the desk and make the registration. The airport charges us 30 euro per person. I tried send my issue to the Ryanair compliance dept, but all of the answers was like "" Change device, you have to talk on the chat and etc"" Just wanna get back my check-in fee . Nothing, just feeling you talked to a wall. I have very bad experience with the company and will try to avoid it in the future.",0,1.0
"Couldn’t find any reason to complain. Outbound flight on time, clean aircraft and Cabin Crew friendly and well presented. Great value for money. It was cheaper to fly to Dublin for the day on Ryanair rather than go to London from Bristol for the day by rail. Although the seats do not recline, I thought the leg room was fine. I have flown Ryanair several times over the years and have come to the conclusion that as long as you stick to the rules with regards checking in on line and adhere to luggage sizes, journeys are hassle free generally. Flight was late on the return leg but they emailed an apology before the dedicated check in time. That didn’t bother me personally. Their website is designed to capture more money related to seat allocation, earlier checkin, luggage upgrades, insurance, etc etc but they are optional and as long as you know what you want, there is no obligation to increase the price of your journey. I find their website and online check in very easy to use. I’m a pensioner and I’m grateful Ryanair offers fares at great value.",1,1.0
"The duration of this flight is 1h and 20m but we stayed inside the freezing plane one more hour, allegedly not Ryanair's fault but Lisbon's airport. Eventually they turned on the heat when it took off but when approaching Madeira the coldness was back. As usual, dirty plane.",0,1.0
"Play the game and you'll be fine. Got a return flight from Leeds Bradford to Faro for £101. I booked 3 months ahead, didn't reserve a seat, and took only a small bag. Had my boarding pass both on my app, and in paper format (just in case). Took my own food and drink on the plane, didn't buy any of theirs, and didn't buy any of their duty free etc. It really does pay to do your research. At Leeds Bradford someone had lost their boarding pass (I think that cost them £60), while at Faro someone's cabin bag was too big. That had to go in the hold, and I expect that cost him. He said it was OK at Leeds, but maybe he got away with it there. My old bag would have been too big, but I checked Ryanair's website, and bought a new and conforming bag for £9.99. I'm 6 foot tall, and the leg room is tight, but just about OK for a 3 hour flight. The seats were uncomfortable though and needed more cushioning. The outward flight took off and arrived on time. The cabin crew were friendly and efficient. No hard sales pitch for food, drink, duty free. The announcements could have been clearer, but that was down to the Portuguese captain. The return flight was about an hour late taking off, due to delays experienced earlier in the day. This happens. Allow for it. They made up 20 minutes and the plane landed at Leeds Bradford 40 minutes behind schedule. Absolutely no complaints whatsoever and fantastic value for money. I'd reckon that the negative views on here are hugely in the minority. In some cases things have gone wrong, but in others part of the blame must be with the posters who haven't researched and prepared well.",1,0.890864434363652
"Most importantly Ryanair took me from A to B, safe and in a new plane. However, often flying with Ryanair is a tiring thing. The boarding process can simply be a pain as between scanning your pass and effectively letting you on the plane they let passengers stand in line for long time, often in cramped places. Surely it is to assure everyone is there, can board quickly and enable the closing of the doors of the plane on time, but is quite a torture (many other airlines try to avoid such thing, probably with more differentiation of boarding groups). Furthermore, on this specific flight, the crew truly was a pain trying to sell all kind of “Duty Free” (non existing, as it was a domestic flight) items. The announcements took a full 10 minutes on a 60 min flight (sum it up with the safety instructions, buy on board of catering items, pilot’s message(s) etc), reading out all kind of “special offers” for more or less low ranking articles and was loud. Most “refined marketing action” was the seat belts sign to be turned on, for no reason whatsoever (quiet flying conditions), to assure proper sales of articles.",1,0.5388086479612366
"One of the biggest rip-off companies out there. They give flights at good prices, and then will find any possible way to charge you additional money an make your trip as expensive as possible. Want to cancel your reservation within 24h from the purchase? Not possible. Need some time to choose which luggage you'll need? Be ready to pay double price for that, right after the booking. Want to change your flight? Double price just for the fees. They are tracking everything you do in their app to show you higher prices wherever they can. Customer service replies but doesn't help at all. 100% shameful company.",0,0.6813967819210923
"Took four flights with Ryanair this autumn, Nuremberg to Thessaloniki return and Hahn to Vilnius return. Flawless job. All four flights were pleasantly uneventful, departure and arrival strictly on time (that was especially crucial for me because I needed to take a bus for a consequent journey and a late arrival could be an issue). Very quick check-in and boarding (almost no queues), I'm being amazed with such efficiency of processes again and again. And, of course, really cheap prices (especially to Vilnius, they are even cheaper than bus tickets for the same route, but even to a summer holidays destination which Thessaloniki is, the prices are much more affordable than the competitors' ones). I chose Ryanair many times this year and the company haven't given me any reason to be disappointed so far. Well done Ryanair!",1,1.0
"We were delayed for more than 8 hours at Oslo airport, Torp. We filed a complaint and Ryanair contacted me directly with this message and have now paid me more than EUR 500: ""7 Oct 2023, 05:51 GMT+1 Dear Nils Erik, Thank you for your reply. We sincerely regret the delay on your flight FR3278 from Oslo Torp to Gdansk on the 12/12/2022. We wish to confirm that a transfer for the sum of 5652.02 NOK (equivalent to 250 EUR per customer and 386 NOK for meal expenses) has been authorised by Ryanair in full and final settlement of your claim under EU261.""

"Ryanair and we decided to book again for end of October. Unfortunately a war broke out in Israel and the whole world knows what is going on. I spoke to Ryanair Customer Service and explained that with the current situation with friends and family missing we can’t possibly go on vacation, and if under the circumstances we can exchange our dates. I was told that the flight has not been cancelled by the airline and therefore we are not eligible for a change or refund. I find this indifference quite appalling from the airline, as no one is cancelling for the sake of it, and under these circumstances some leniency should be given by the company.",0,1.0
"I have booked this flight as a part of an itinerary which included various others flights with other airlines. As a last minute situation (unexpected severe health issue) presented itself I had to cancel the whole itinerary and wanted to possibly reschedule the Ryanair flight. To my surprise I was confronted with the unpleasant situation in which there were no reasonable options. For any suggestion I proposed the company had a countermeasure/policy which will not allow me to make a change or if so, at a prohibitive price to the point that it would have been better to simply buy a new ticket. At the end the only option left was to cancel with no refund. It was truly very unpleasant to deal with Ryanair.",0,1.0
"I booked 3 flights through Expedia. I received no specific policy nor check in requirements regarding this flight from Expedia. I was at the airport on day of departure and had to pay £165.00 as a penalty to get boarding passes as I had not checked in online. I had no knowledge of this procedure, or fee. I had no choice but To pay this in order to fly with my sisters on this much anticipated vacation. I have repeatedly tried to speak with Ryanair to explain this gap in knowledge and unknown penalty fees.",0,1.0
"I took a Ryanair flight three days ago from Copenhagen to Vienna without any problem. Today, I took the return flight. I was this time told I must pay a penalty fee for my identical bag. I told them I came three days ago with Ryanair, with the same bag. Ryanair’s staff did not believe me. I offered them the ticket as proof. They ignored it and shouted at me to ‘pay the fine or you cannot board the plane’. I then removed a large duvet cover from my bag, after which the bag fit into their standard model box. Still, they ignored it, and repeated: pay or be left behind. Upon request, they also refused to give me their names, or the name of their manager. I must now reconsider my future choices.",0,1.0
"People get quite angry about Ryanair, and I can well imagine that if something goes wrong you are really in trouble. But this trip was pleasantly uneventful. So long as you understand the baggage and other rules, and don't (for example) waste money on priority boarding, it can be fine. I paid for a seat at the front, and fast-track security at Stansted. The flights were both about half-an-hour late, but other than that I've no complaints. And there seem to be fewer annoying announcements on board these days.",1,0.8750635065106281

Charleroi - Carcassonne return. Both flights landed on time or ahead of schedule. Outbound was with one of their newer B737 MAX planes which offers less engine noise which was nice. Crew on the outbound leg friendly and efficient. Front crew on the return leg looked not motivated and not over friendly overall. Beverage and meal service efficient as always with good selections at ok prices. We have had no issues with Ryanair so far and they are often the only choice for certain destinations if you want a direct flight out of Belgium like in this case. Would still recommend them!,1,0.990904748647977
"First time on 8022 and, although a nice aircraft and quieter than the 800, the seating is appalling. We were in row 26 and the pitch I measured at 27"" - the least I have ever had to suffer.

I also had to wear my reading spectacles to read the information on the seat in front. Flight was on time and crew pleasant.",1,1.0
"I had a flight from Charleroi airport Brussels to Athens through Ryanair, and booking that flight was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. I asked the boarding representative to book two seats next to each other (regardless of the location) for my wife and I. The representatives answer was no, and he said I have to separate you as per Ryanair policy because this is a paid service even though we had multiple seats empty on the air craft. Once I arrived to the airport, Ryanair representative informed me that I had to pay 55 Eur for each person for airport boarding because the online boarding (the free one) gets locked 2 hours before the flight because they offer cheap flights prices.",0,1.0
The experience was awful from the luggage check in to the boarding followed by an hour departure delayed. The wait before taking off in a 35 degree plane as the air conditioning was broken.

Incompetent rude ground and flight agents that will never see my money!,0,1.0
"Ryanair is now obliging passengers who buy airline tickets other than on its own website to go through a complex validation process that involves taking a photograph of their civil identification document (lots of attempts) and a photograph of the passenger's own face! The company always manages to do what it wants without obeying the rules of absolutely every other airline on the market. But I think this goes way beyond what is reasonable. The prices on Ryanair's website are always higher than in some online travel agencies. Very friendly, even charming crew.",0,1.0
"We were three persons to fly and each paid more than € 100 for a singe-way ticket to Alicante, without paying extra to choose a seat. The checkin at the airport was based on the Ryanair app, which was confusing. Luckily a staff came to help us, verified everything and sent us towards the gates. At the gates it turned out that the flight was overbooked, there were 2 tickets more sold than there were actual seats on the plane, and because we didn't choose our seat we couldn't board the plane. We had to wait until the end of boarding to see if there were at least three no-shows, and then we would get their seats assigned to us. If everyone showed up, we wouldn't be able to fly. I didn't pay 100+ euro per ticket to not even be allowed on the plane because it's overbooked!  Ryanair is the worst possible experience.",0,1.0

Not only does he treat you badly, but he also tries to penalize you even more. 4) During the entire flight they use the public address system for advertising, ridiculous. 5) All the landings are horrible, it seems like they do it on purpose. 6) They break your suitcase.

"We booked this flight because it was cheap and was supposed to get us to Bristol with 3 hours to spare for our connecting. In Beziers, all passengers were stuck for 5 hours in a hot, poorly air conditioned waiting room. No information was provided on departure, just delayed. Found out that Ryanair doesn't have a single employee at this airport, not 1. Finally the flight left and landed late night at Bristol, 2 hours after our connecting flight departed. We filed claims for rebooking our connecting flight, the hotel that we were charged at the other end (24 hour no cancel policy) and the hotel in Bristol that we had to take. Ryanair only paid for the connecting flight rebooking. We are out of pocket over $600. They admit it was a mechanical problem with the plane that was fixed well in time for the light to leave on time but they had no maintenance staff at the airport to sign off on the minor repair. They had to fly in a maintenance person to sign off on it. 5 hours later we left. Horrible, horrible airline. Horrible communication. I called their customer service line (which is was difficult to even find) and they charged my credit card $50 just to take the call!",0,1.0

No understanding, patience, nor sympathetic that I had 3 children under 5 yo with me and the check in for all of them was done save for mine and my father’s check in.

At 19h already Google suggested the flight might be delayed as the previous flight was over 1h late yet they never bothered saying it was late-  even past take-off time. People queuing and waiting all over the gate, but they don't care or bother to say their flight is late so they're perfectly comfortable wasting people's time and keeping them at the gate for no reason without information.

"We experienced a very unpleasant conflict during the boarding process in Burgas, flight FR3705. Despite having no issues at check-in, we checked in our paid baggage and had four cabin bags for four passengers. However, we were forced to pay extra for a small suitcase because we were in the priority line after being called forward by the stewards. It was evident that they were struggling with the boarding process and thus opened both lines for everyone. After an unpleasant exchange of words, they took the suitcase from us and we had to pay an additional 46EUR, claiming that the suitcase wouldn't be allowed on board unless we paid. We eventually paid the money, received a tag, and the staff informed us that we would find the suitcase during check-in in Bratislava. None of this materialized. We were forced to paid 46EUR for a service that utterly failed. The way the stewards in Burgas communicated and coerced us was absolutely distasteful. While loading the rest of our baggage into the plane's storage area, the vast majority of suitcases similar in size to ours were accommodated without issue.",0,1.0
"We were a group of 5 travelling across Europe and we went with Ryanair for one of our flights. Turns out this was our first and our last flight with them. Their staff is cold and seem like they hate their job. They charged one of us 30€ to check-in one person. 30€ just to print a small piece of paper? On top of that, they charged me 50€ because my cabin bag didn't fit their testing tool, even though there was room for my bag to fit their over-head compartment. No other company charges 30€ for check-in in person nor both forces you to test the size of your cabin bag and makes you pay in front of everyone. To add to the injury, the inside of the plane is very old and basic: small leg room, seats don't recline, no entertainment.",0,1.0

Very shady fees, and rude customer service.",0,1.0
"I would like to point out that the airline is a 'Budget airline' and it's pretty popular in Europe and north Africa, and RYANAIR is the most well known of them all for various reasons (mostly negative). BOOKING AND CHECK-IN: To book your flight like every other airline you do it online, through their website or their own app, booking a flight is easy enough and the first thing that will surprise you is how cheap tickets can get, some goes for less than 20 Euros, and many of them don't go over 100 Euros (depending on when you're booking), although that's very good you soon realise why the airline is hated, as when you choose your ticket you're bombarded with fees left and right for everything else besides the ticket. You have a big bag you want to take with you? That would be 30€ extra. Want to bring a small cabin bag? You can only do that by buying priority Which is at least 25€...etc the only thing you can bring is one backpack for free that weighs less than 10kg. They also try to sell you on offers such as compensation etc, but for the most part it's absolutely not worth it, so don't spend your money on them. In terms of checking you can do it for free only when there's less than 24 hours left on the flight online, if you come to check in at the airport you'll be charged 30€ for them to check-in for you and give you the boarding pass, so keep that in mind! WAITING AND BOARDING: It's the day you take your flight! Remember that when you get through security, to look at the departures carefully, because 3 times out of ten they will change their gate (that's if they show you the gate early, they usually show it until there's less than an hour for the planes departure), stay alert! After that you during boarding you must wait until it's your turn (if you don't have priority) and go to your plane! In the boarding pass you printed or given they will tell you where to board, because Ryanair uses both the front and the rear for boarding people, and rarely use normal gates. After you've boarded, sit, relax if you can, because the seats aren't the best and they aren't reclinable. The food is also not free so if you want anything you have to pay (they also don't accept cash, only cards). END OF TRIP: And there you go, you've survived the trip with (hopefully) little to no extra money spent! All and all as much as this review is negative in many aspects, to be completely fair you get what you pay for, if you know what you're doing already and/or made research to be prepared you shouldn't have any problems! It's a very good airline for the fact they give such cheap tickets to people like me (a student) who can't afford ""big airlines"" and can go with only a backpack! It's also a different story if you go with your family or friends as in my situation all my flights in Ryanair were solo! Just watch out for their scummy behaviour to extract more money and try to not book the flight on third party websites. For me I'll give it a solid 6/10 because for many people like me the airline is a life saver, but it's definitely not for everybody to use.",0,0.719095304598377

The queues were quite long and they sent us to the wrong queue even I asked them politely to get in the right one. When we had only 1 hour left I thought we might miss our flight. We asked them for assistance but they didn’t do anything at all. Many staffs there were so tired and unhelpful. They didn’t send is any emails about the fees for checking in at the airport and we were charged £330 for it. Finally, we still missed our flight and had to be on ‘standby’ twice. It cost us a lot more money and time, ruined our holiday. It was totally exhausted. It was our first time with Ryanair and the last time as well. We will never use them again. They don’t deserve even 1 star.",0,0.8335916444085661
"The worst airline ever. Our flight from Marrakech back to Berlin was canceled due to a strike in the BER Airport, Germany.  Not only did they not pay compensation, but also do not pay my money back for the canceled flight. The money is now already for 3 months in my Ryanair Account and I have inquired like 10 times to pay me back the money to my credit card. I have even sent personal identity documents. Nothing - no reaction whatsoever. They are strictly ignoring me.  Avoid Ryanair if you can!",0,0.8526886961381349
"Worst Airline I ever had to deal with. Super incompetent and unfriendly staff. It really was a nightmare. I booked my flights via booking.com and added check in luggage for 116$ on the airport I got told I appreciate don’t have any luggage included although showing him the extra luggage fee I paid via booking. He could apparently not find it and I had to pay my luggage again in the airport for 95Euro. I also got told that it’s mandatory when flying with Ryanair to online check in. Check in at the airport is only free if you are more then 2hour prior to the flight at check in desk. I arrived 2,5 prior my flight on the airport but I wasn’t on the desk till 1:50 prior. So I had to pay another 55 euro to be checked in.  When arriving on my gate there was a line for boarding. I had paid 20 euro extra for priority. I walked up to the desk and told one Ryanair woman that I had priority. She just said we called out priority 5-10 min ago if your weren’t coming forward then now you have to go back in line with the rest. This has been a absolute joke and disaster.",0,1.0
"Flight was delayed by 20 minutes, and one crew member was quite rude and had an attitude from the beginning of the flight for no reason. Leg room isn’t great and as a 6’3 person I had to sit in the aisle to stretch my legs. However, it is cheap",1,1.0

The steps were still attached to the plane, the doors were open, and people were still finding their seats, yet the staff at the gate refused me boarding. I mentioned they had only just called final boarding (not gate closed, but final boarding) and her response was ""don't listen to the announcement"". I then had to pay for a hotel and another flight the next morning. I've complained to Ryanair and they've sent a generic response about getting to the airport 2 hours early. I was there 3 hours early and seconds behind the other passenger.",0,0.9646667251197822
"The single worst airline I have ever flown with in my whole life. I have flown with Ryanair about a dozen times and probably 10 of them were late by more than an hour.

Cherry on top, had to wait another hour for the suitcase.",0,0.9921485722834448

Total waste of time and money paying for Priority Boarding when you have allocated seats Quick turn around meant aircraft hadn’t been cleaned. Crisps and biscuits all over the floor around the seat. Normal crew members more interested in selling food and lotto tickets rather than concentrating on safety. Real concern was the fact those sat in the over-wing exit row, two rows in front of us had plastic pint glasses full of beer they were drinking from during approach landing and taxi at Gatwick. So much for the so called final cabin checks.",1,0.4820783983388167

"We took Ryanair for all of our flights within Europe. 3/4 of flights were OK except that they were all at least 1 hour late. I was OK with this and was expecting this based on their reputation. On our flight from Berlin to Venice, we were re-routed and had to land in Verona about 1.5 hours from Venice (Treviso) due to a major storm. Ryanair has no ground staff to assist people which is why they can be 'budget'. We landed late at night and 3 other Ryanair flights also landed in Verona due to the storm. There was a very nice lady employed by Verona Airport who was helping all the Ryanair customers. We were told to wait for buses arranged by Ryanair to take people from Verona to Treviso airport. People were fighting to get on the buses and we didn't understand why anyone would behave that way, considering Ryanair must surely know exactly how many buses they need to send based on how many flights/passengers had landed. Well, we were wrong. We also felt we should have been the last to go on the bus since all 3 other planes had landed before us and waited much longer. There were 40 people still left and we were told that the last bus was coming but it could fit only 16 people. Ryanair informed the airport over the phone that they would reimburse taxi fares for the remaining people. I am here to tell you that after months of back-and-forth email communication with Ryanair, they notified us that they do not need to reimburse us for a natural calamity since it's not their fault. I understand that's their policy, but I wish we were not misled to believe that the taxi cost would be reimbursed. If we had known what we know now, we could have taken a taxi as soon as we landed instead of waiting for 3 hours on the sidewalk outside of Verona airport. If you are flying with this airline, just hope that you don't end up with any special situation needing customer service, otherwise you are probably OK.",0,1.0
"They have unreasonable policies and impose excessively punitive fines if you don't follow them to the letter. You can't bring a small hand luggage (only a backpack). You need to pay priority to bring a small hand luggage. I had a backpack, but on my way back they claimed that it was bigger than what was allowed. I did put it in their box, but they claimed it didn't quite fit. They charged me £80 for a backpack. They refused to accept cash and refused to accept apple pay. Even though I was willing to pay, they made no effort to help me and were ready to prevent me from boarding, unless I paid with a credit card. I gave them my credit card and they claimed that it wasn't accepted. I had to log into my bank account to show them that they took the money. They let me board seconds before the gate was closed. I asked for a receipt. Their printer was broken and they said they would email it to me. They didn't. The argument is that because their flights are cheap, they are entitled to treat passengers this way.",0,1.0

We got ripped off when we went to counter to check in. They said we have to pay €124 because I didn’t check in online and I wasn’t allowed to check in online at that stage. This is in addition to the delay and poor check in process. The total amount of our ticket was €140 and we paid the same amount just for a check in.,0,1.0
"Avoid like the plague. Ground crew is not helpful. We were unable to check in online due to a Wi-Fi failure on the airport. We expected some consideration from the Ryanair-staff. After a rather unpleasant conversation we had to pay £100 for our boarding passes. But they only accepted credit cards which we didn't have. So we couldn't fly. Staff were ice-cold. That's how they are trained. Finally, a friend paid for us. But we had already missed our flight because of this. Now we had to rebook our tickets. Of course, again we received the emotionless treatment of the staff and an extra 200 pounds lighter, we were finally able to leave London Stansted Airport. Ryanair takes advantage of the fact people don't own a credit card, and they do this on purpose. It's just a low strategy to make a bit of extra money.",0,1.0
"Ryanair is as basic as cheap flying can get. Your initial costs seem low but you should add the price of an additional passenger to your calculations, in case anything will go wrong. We booked two flights over Ryanair. Dortmund to Katowice and vice versa. As all cheap airlines, Ryanair has strict measurements for the size of the luggage you're allowed to bring. While boarding the machine on the first flight, Dortmund to Katowice, our Luggage was measured by the ground and fit into the Ryanair restrictions. While boarding the flight back the very same luggage somehow did not fit into size regulations, and we were charged an additional 310 PLN (about 71,82€ at current rates) per piece of luggage. All that while other passengers that went by with visibly larger luggage were not asked to measure and could proceed to board unbothered by the ground staff. In addition, as we boarded the machine, the staff informed us that our Luggage would be too large to store it in the cabin, and had to be transported inside the cargo department of the plane. Which of course comes with extra waiting times at the airport. In addition, we booked a rental car at Katowice Airport over Ryanair. Of course, there where some problems with the booking and we had to cancel the booking and ended up paying about 70% more for the car as we initially would have.",0,1.0
"The flight overall was good, ground staff were no fuss at Newcastle, the flight was delayed by about 30 minutes but the time got made up during the flight, landing at Fuerteventura after a flawless 4.5 hour flight, food was good, not too overpriced, once the plane landed they got straight to offloading the bags, passport control only took 5 minutes, and when we got to the baggage hall the bags were there.

They send an email to check in the day before (like everyone) but also say you will be charged 30 euro if you don't check in online. The app is so confusing and chaotic. The record locator evidently doesn't indicate that you have already paid for luggage. There is no way to skip the screen (I was told later I should have just checked the box for undersea bag only for no charge) How was I supposed to know that? We both had suitcases and backpacks for overhead. So I had to pay again to even check in. I told them at the customer service desk what happened and gave my documentation showing I had paid twice. No refunds. Not under any circumstances. Boarding was late and chaotic. It was an awful and awfully expensive experience. Never again.",0,1.0
"My recent flight with Ryanair from Lisbon to Stansted turned into a nightmare due to the behavior of two specific crew members. Their actions made the journey highly inconvenient for my family and several other passengers. It seemed their main objective was to extract extra money from travelers for baggage, which created a tense and unpleasant atmosphere during boarding. The trouble began when a passenger in front of us was forced to pay for their bag, even though it appeared perfectly fine from our viewpoint. We voiced our concerns, hoping for some empathy from the crew member. Unfortunately, this only seemed to provoke them to target us next. On a hot day in Lisbon, we had placed our jackets in a foldable bag, adhering to the baggage policy. However, as we were being briefed on the rules, we put our jackets on. After a discussion with a colleague, the crew member allowed us to proceed. While in the queue, one of my daughters, who has asthma, removed her jacket and hat. Suddenly, the same crew member appeared, ordering us out of the line and threatening to deny us boarding. Despite explaining that nothing had changed since they had previously allowed us through, they remained stubborn. They called another crew member over, and both of them joined in a verbal assault. They disregarded the fact that the extra bags were gadgets belonging to my child and wife, insisting that we could only carry four bags. Their behavior was not only rude and disrespectful but also unprofessional, displaying personal animosity and complete disregard for our well-being. It was evident that this crew member was actively seeking an excuse to single us out and personally target us. Our attempts to explain were met with increasing firmness, dismissiveness, and even mockery. Their conduct left a lasting negative impression, overshadowing what should have been a smooth and stress-free journey. I am deeply disappointed that Ryanair employs individuals who lack professionalism and take their frustrations out on innocent customers. This experience was disheartening, leading me to question whether I would choose to fly with Ryanair in the future. The treatment we received was unacceptable, and I sincerely hope that the airline takes this feedback seriously and addresses the conduct of its crew members.",0,1.0

The rep “Mark” who was there when we boarded in June 17th at 5.55am flight to London, said that they were supposed to overcharge us on the way to Edinburgh. I said these carry-ons fit in the overhead bins. He said, if you want to travel without paying, then these carry-ons should stay!

"I recently had an extremely frustrating experience with Ryanair that left me disappointed and dissatisfied with their service. Despite it not being mandatory to complete web check-in for my flight, I was unjustly charged a hefty fee of 40EUR due to an error on their part. Upon arriving at the airport, I was informed that I needed to pay the additional fee because I had not completed the web check-in process. However, according to Ryanair's own policy, web check-in is not mandatory, and passengers are still able to check in at the airport without incurring any charges. I found it incredibly unfair and frustrating that I was penalized for their own mistake. The customer service representative I approached for assistance was unhelpful and unsympathetic to my situation. They showed no willingness to resolve the issue or provide any explanation for the unnecessary charge. This lack of professionalism only added to my dissatisfaction. As a frequent flyer, I have had positive experiences with several other airlines that prioritize customer satisfaction and go above and beyond to rectify their mistakes. Unfortunately, Ryanair fell far short of these expectations. The incident left a sour taste in my mouth and has significantly impacted my perception of Ryanair as a reliable and customer-centric airline. The lack of transparency and the unwarranted charge have made me question their commitment to customer service and fairness. I strongly advise other travelers to be cautious when booking with Ryanair and to carefully review their policies and fees. It is disheartening to experience such disregard for customer satisfaction, and I hope that Ryanair takes this feedback constructively and works towards improving their service and rectifying their mistakes. Overall, my experience with Ryanair was deeply disappointing, and I cannot recommend them based on the unjust charges and lack of accountability I encountered.",0,1.0

"We had a wonderful holiday in Italy which was dampened by the treatment of Ryanair staff at the Fiumicino airport. Ryanair disguises their prices as low, but they purposely try to trick you and find everything wrong with your booking when you are at the airport in order for you to pay extra fees (which you are forced to pay because you are desperate to get onto the flight). I first witnessed an older couple so excited to be on holiday but rudely told by the counter staff that they did not check in on time so they have to pay €100. I was saddened by this as the couple looked so old and were taken advantage. They make it very difficult to check in online (you can only do it within a ridiculous timeframe) so once again you are forced to pay the fees. The staff at the counters before boarding also treated my sister like a criminal because her bag was a little larger then regulations. Screaming at her and embarrassing her, it was so sad. This is not how people should be treated when they are happy to go on holiday and work very hard to get time off. I implored with the staff that there was no reason to be rude. To top it off, when we arrived in Athens, our friends suitcase was broken. I would not recommend Ryanair and it would be better off going with another airline even if it costs more as you end up paying more with Ryanair after the additional fees they trick you into paying once you are at the airport.",0,1.0

The only trouble was that the flight was slightly late (~20 mins) in both directions so I had doubts if I will be able to catch the bus for the following parts of my trip, but luckily everything went smoothly. Will definitely choose Ryanair for my future trips.",1,1.0
Very bad experience. The flight was delayed almost 4 hours. Had to pay for all refreshments which were ridiculously expensive although their policy said the refreshments were free if the flight was delayed more than 2 hrs which was. I will avoid this airline in the future.,0,1.0
Would like to pass a feedback to Antonio and all cabin crew who operated FAO-STN flight on 22nd of April. Grooming and customer service skills were met to a high standards. Friendly approach made a flight experience even more better and relaxed. Well done guys!,1,1.0
"I had thought Ryanair would have improved over the years, but I was completely wrong. The cheap flights are completely offset by added charges. Firstly with bags, the size they provide as acceptable cabin bags are miniscule - barely enough to fit a days worth of clothes and items - so we purchased a cabin bag. The cabin bag they allow is the size of a usual carry on; the small wheeled suitcases so many people use. However when we got to check in, everyone with us (after the priority boarding) had these suitcases with no problem? We paid to have a bag checked in, when everyone else carried theirs on with no problem. That was £55 extra. We then had to pay to sit next to each other, as I was travelling with my partner. We paid for this on one flight, and for the return flight we checked in as soon as online check in was open. Even though there were only a couple of seats already booked and the entire plane was empty, it deliberately seated us far apart in order to make us pay more. When it says they cannot guarantee you will be seated next to each other, take it to mean they will deliberately seat you far apart in order to get more money from you. Finally on the flight, having a flight attendant scream right next to you, as they yell at their colleague at the other end of the plane was interesting. Even more so was the aggressive way they do anything. I walk using a walking aid, and I called up to check this was ok before I boarded. After being told it was ok and that I would be able to keep the walking aid between my legs, an attendant roughly grabbed it on the flight and shoved it into an already full overhead locker, and then slammed it shut several times until it closed. This cracked and damaged the walking aid and I've now had to purchase another. When I submitted a complaint about this, I was told I needed to have filled in a particular form at the airport. I have never had an attendant damage the items I use to walk around before, and at no point does it say that if anything is damaged you need to fill in a form at the airport. I was then stuck in a loop of calling in to discuss this issue, being told to reply to an email and then being told they would do nothing as this form was not filled in. Ryanair remains a predatory airline - you will not pay the low amount you see online. Avoid them, and give your money to any of the other budget airlines if you're looking to save money. Will never fly with Ryanair again.",0,1.0
"Got us late both ways. Also caused us to miss a following train. Saw confusion on their bags policy. A guy paid for it but they didn't allow him baggage for some reason, which wasted everyone's time. At arrival in London on return flight, they didn't open gate for 30 minutes after stopping the plane.",0,1.0

"Ryanair - only for masochists. We booked early. So we could have the whole Tuesday in London. Then the flight was moved to the evening. I tried to cancel, but with little luck. Waited 30 minutes for help on the phone. The instructions I was given didn't work. Gave up and decided to use the late flight. And then the flight was delayed by 1 hour. Arrived so late in London - all the restaurants were closed! Our Tuesday wasted completely. So - will try to avoid Ryanair in the future. There are other companies.",0,1.0
"I always try to find the cheapest flight to wherever I need to go, and it always ends up being with Ryanair. But I will say, no matter what the price is this airline is awful. The bag requirements for baggage under the seat is way too small. My husband and I have fit numerous “oversized” bags under the seat perfectly fine, but once in a while they will charge us almost €50 for the baggage. That is way over priced for even what the app charges for an extra bag. Also again, it’s ridiculous that I pack super light but they consider my bag too big just because it’s a hiking bag. It’s hard finding other airlines to fly and Ryanair is the most convenient one all the time but man do I hate flying with them. Also the staff when checking into the flight during boarding is always awful and so rude. I feel like they just always want to look for trouble.",0,1.0

Ryanair did not want to do anything and indicated that I needed to contact the car rental company myself.

"Keeping in mind that Ryanair is a low cost airline I have never had many troubles with it. That was until I departed from Valencia airport. The Ryanair staff at the airport was truly horrible. They made me pay almost 50 euros for a tiny purse I was carrying in my hand. They wouldn't give me the time to reorganize my backpack to have my purse fit into it, threatening me that I would miss my flight. I'm wondering if they get a premium for trying to milk extra money from their customers. They also forced me to put check in my backpack with my laptop in it. This had never happened to me before and I fly with low cost airlines multiple times a month. Extremely unpleasant experience.",0,1.0
"Return flight ZAG-AGP-ZAG in mid - March 2023. Booking flights on the Ryanair app is easy and straightforward. Very reasonably priced tickets are bought 2 months in advance. Flights from ZAG are operated by Lauda Europe and their A320 in 180 seat config. Boarding was on time with a bit of queuing. The young and very enthusiastic crew offered very good service with lots of smiles. Both flights were on time. Onboard products are reasonably priced.

"What can I say about the appalling treatment we received. We arrived at the airport in plenty of time to find that the flight was delayed by an hour. We were due to fly to Dublin at 10 so we’re loaded on the plane for an 11 flight not to much of a problem. We took our seats to be informed that there was a delay due to defrosting the aircraft, first off told 30 mins, then we were next in the queue, then told we were waiting for air traffic then told again waiting for defrosting, this went on for an hour and a half then they unloaded some passengers who were fed up with the delay and lies. We were then told we would be going soon. Asked if there was any chance of a drink and told they didn’t have any then told I could have a bottle of water but it would cost me to which I laughed. We had a connection to Rome at 15.30 hrs we were told that they had contacted Aer Lingus to inform them we were on our way we then took off at 13.45 on arrival at Dublin we had missed our connecting flight and Aer Lingus knew nothing of this and we’re informed by the very helpful Ryanair desk it was nothing to do with them. It was the worst customer service I have ever received. I will never fly with this awful airline again",0,1.0
"I will never again book with Ryanair - the poorest customer service I have ever received in my life. We booked our flights out to Pisa (for our Wedding this August - 11 months later) last Sept and just 2 weeks after booking they changed our flights by 5.5 hrs going out and 7 hrs coming back. To add insult we paid for their most expensive flights to get good flight times to make the most of our Wedding holiday, as did 40+ of our guests too; and they put us onto their cheapest ‘night flights’ that are still selling online now dirt cheap. It’s 4.5 months on since they changed our online booking (no notification, we just found by fluke by logging in), but when we rang they said they cannot change the flight until it is confirmed then we will ‘receive an e-mail’ to be able to request a refund or accept the new flights. I call every month and e-mail every month but I get the same text book answer ‘you can change your flights when you receive your e-mail of the change, which could be up until 3 months prior to your flight date’ - So Ryanair's customer service answer is wait 6 months until all other flight prices are sky high so we can’t afford to request a refund and must accept our overly inflated cost of night flights, as we bought them under false pretenses. We have 10 children all under the age of 10 with us, some are babies and we’re now stranded on a flight home at 10pm after we lose our accommodation at 10am, due to Ryanair's poor duty of care and customer service.",0,1.0

The only remark is the hurry to get aboard and disabord the airplane, due to the tight time table, but it's fine for me. I would fly again with them.",1,1.0

This is nothing but a sneaky way for them to nickel and dime unsuspecting passengers. Not only that, but the staff were incredibly rude and unhelpful throughout the entire process. They seemed to take pleasure in making my experience as miserable as possible. I've flown with a lot of budget airlines in the past, but Ryanair takes the cake for being the worst.

My main issue is with our flight schedule change. We were supposed to go on 6.20 am flight and were told by email and by contacting ""ask Ryanair"" that this flight was rescheduled, we got an option to change for free to the 4 pm flight.

Flew Ryanair EDI/FUE/EDI. I can honestly say that it was very good both ways. It's true at the gate in EDI they were bordering on being militant with the hand luggage but at the end of the day the website asks multiple times how much you wish to take in the cabin so if people try to pull a fast one and get caught out it's their own fault. Crew onboard were professional and worked hard on both flights.,1,0.9766464734132749

They send us an email that we will get compensation for the delay. But when I applied - the answer was that the delay was due to the airport technical delay not the company itself. So no compensation. Not to mention, they cancelled my flight to Italy two years ago due to COVID restrictions but didn’t cancel the flight back. Never received any compensation for that as well.

While Ryanair is largely responsible for stimulating the local economy, the social, tax and environmental cost is also very high.

"When we boarded the aircraft they made us wait over an hour as they found a fault and decided to do a check…the check should have been done before letting people board the aircraft. Firstly we were told that a new aircraft will be ready by 18:00 (the flight was at 14:30). At 18:00 we were told to wait till 21:35, at 21:35 we were told to wait till 3:30AM which after we were asked to wait till 6:10am, 6:10 am there was still no aircraft ready. I asked for an expenses form and no one could help me, the website would not allow me to change my flight free of charge like the email from Ryanair stated and when I asked a staff member for help once again their response was “sorry we can’t help you”, After 10 hours of delay I asked the staff for help with a hotel and their response once again was “sorry we can’t help you if you chose to go it’s at your own experiences” to which I asked if I were to go home and get some sleep and come back an hour before the flight is estimated would I be allowed onto my very delayed flight to which the response I received from the staff was “we don’t know we can’t help you with that” for a £250 flight and a total of 18hours of delay we received a £3 voucher which was not even enough for a coffee and a bottle of water. I was so distressed and upset I decided to cancel my flight and retrieve my bags, just as I thought it couldn’t get worse when I received my luggage back it came ruined and damaged! Once again I asked a staff member for help and I was told “I don’t know take pictures or something I can’t help you”. The two staff members were also very very rude, they were making very nasty comments about the non English speaking passengers who appeared to not understand English, calling your passengers “stupid, annoying and idiotic” is very unprofessional especially when your answer to everything is “I can’t help you I can only show you where the exit doors are”.

"This review relates to my second flight with Ryanair following a trip to Fuerteventura. The check-in staff at Fuerteventura airport were very professional and friendly too. Boarding was something of a mishap as there was no reinforcement of the priority boarding. This caused an upheaval as several passengers, rightly voiced their grievances over this. This was a very full flight including several family groups. The cabin crew were far more professional than on my outbound flight and imposed a strict no nuts regime as a passenger had a nut allergy. One crew member stood out from her peers, who was not only very professional but seemed to go the extra mile to assist an elderly couple and to help a lady who was unwell. This crew member is a great credit to Ryanair and deserves recognition for her professionalism and common sense. During the flight 2 to-buys drinks and snacks rounds were performed and again the crew did very well indeed. Although there was a delay of circa 50 minutes to departure this was communicated very well to the passengers. Disembarkation was quite something as a problem passengers stood up before landing and ignored instructions to sit down. This passenger rudely pushed his away along the aisle and brushed a cabin crew member aside. Astonishingly poor behaviour. The cabin crew should not have to deal with such appalling behaviour. Overall a decent flight. The seats are not very comfortable though!",1,0.8791866010038853
"Stansted to Fuerteventura. Firstly, the airline deserves credit for an easy to use website. Follow the rules and one should be just fine within the remit of budget travel! I checked-in online without any issues and when I arrived at the airport, the priority boarding was largely enforced. The flight had a slight delay but communication was reasonable. Another let down was the poor attitude of two staff members. One lady seemed to do all the work while her colleagues took a back-seat attitude. I had a negative experience when I needed to use the lavatory. I politely asked a male member of the cabin crew if the lavatory was free? I am visually impaired. To my shock the staff member in question sighed and mumbled something in another language without answering my question. Disembarkation was a farce as the abusive woman and her brood pushed to the exit without any of the cabin crew correcting the dangerous behaviour eg standing up and removing bags from the locker before the flight had even properly landed. This was quite distressing for many passengers and a clear danger. Moreover the seats were very hard and uncomfortable and the charge for a soft drink was an outrage!",1,1.0
"One of the worst airlines I have seen. There is no coordination among the staff. Initially the flight was at 3:15 pm CET, upon coming 3 hr early to the airport, we found the flight to be departed at 3.53 pm. When we went for the check-in, the staff told wait as the gates weren't announced. And after waiting, when boarding the boarding staff asked to pay for the check fine, which is complete non sense. There is no coordination among the staff. The ground staff are very rude and have no patience to Listen. This unacceptable.",0,1.0
"Ryanair has customer service like it doesn't exist at all: they will say hello and goodbye and leave you as soon as possible. If you get into a problem emergent situation, their colleagues will lie to your face to get rid of you.

Never again will I deal with Ryanair and such a disrespectful and inhumane attitude toward customers.",0,1.0
"Malaga to Tangier with Ryanair. The problems with this flight included a lack of communication over a delay. I looked online and discovered that the flight was delayed leaving Dublin and thus arrived delayed into Malaga. The boarding process was a success in that staff enforced and reinforced the priority system. The aircraft was filthy and had trash on the floor and the windows were also unclean. The young cabin crew had little presence and did not deal with a group of rowdy Spanish teenagers. Disemembarkation was poorly managed too and this flight created a very poor image of the airline. I have been rather put off using Ryanair as a consequence of this experience. I shall add that some passengers only Spoke Arabic and that non of the cabin crew and none of the announcements were made in Arabic, I believe this is a safety issue.",0,0.6918668698606638
Just flown with Ryanair. Flight was on time. Staff at check in desk very pleasant and welcoming. Staff on board the aircraft were very attentive and civil and smiling freely. Flight was good and soft landing. The check in desk let me put my 2 hand luggage cases in the hold free of charge as the plane was full. A very pleasing experience.,1,1.0
"They seem to be providing a cheap service but you will be surprised when you get charged twice as much or even more of the original price. My wife and I had a short flight from Santorini to Athens on October 24, 2022 for which we paid about Euro 90 (45 each) in full, more than a month before the scheduled flight. During the past few days before our flight, I tried several times to check in online as I do with all other flights, but online check-in was not available so I decided to check in at the airport. To my big shock and surprise, I was forced to pay euro 62.15 per person to have our boarding pass issued. I had no choice because we couldn't miss our next flight from Athens to Toronto. After we landed in Athens and my phone was connected to the internet, I received an email from Ryanair asking to check in online with their special app but obviously it was too late for me. This is the first time I face such an unfair charge for such a simple service (issuing a boarding pass). I contacted them asking for a full or partial refund but they rejected my request.",0,1.0

"Booked on return flights from Leeds to Fuerventura, half of our party arrived approximately 2 minutes late for the outbound flight (very careless I know) and were not allowed to board. The other members of the party who were already on the flight insisted on disembarking, flight delayed (would have been easier and quicker to allow late passengers to board) and family argument followed, thanks Ryanair! Ryanair staff blamed Swissair staff and Swissair staff blamed Ryanair ‘jobsworth’. Booked more flights on same day with Jet2, staff could not have been more helpful and enjoyable flight. Holiday went really well but we had to fly back with Ryanair. Rigid cabin bag that was taken on to Leeds flight (before disembarkation) suddenly became too big for return flight according to staff at Fuerteventura Ryanair gate so excess baggage had to be paid. Staff on flight could hardly raise a smile, probably due to the fact they worked for Ryanair, or maybe company policy. In future, unless there is no other alternative, my family will never again fly Ryanair - not that they will care as customer satisfaction is not high on their list of priorities, they are just cargo.",0,0.7779086061876822

"We get to the front to check-in, and we are late by 10 mins so they charge us each 55 pound to check-in (even though the flight was only 30 pound each), then the flight is delayed 3 hours. So we paid an extra 350 pound for nothing. That was from Glasgow to Dublin. Our next flight coming back to Glasgow from Dublin, we get to the gate, all line up in the stairwell, wait for 25+ mins, then they tell us all to come back out as they did not have a flight crew. So as we were exiting the stairwell, I told them there were elderly people standing on the stairs and the woman's response was ""well don't fly Ryanair again."" Then we finally get on the plane 2 hours later, and there's gum stuck to my seat and I had to get 2 different people to help as the first lady just gave me a napkin. And the second just rolled her eyes, then said there's a different spot. When we landed in Glasgow, once again we had to wait, as the pilot said ""sorry but it seems there is no landing crew to guide us in."" I am going to urge people to take the ladies advice and not fly Ryanair. Worst experience of my life. Negative stars if possible.",0,0.861750069565036
I recently had an unpleasant experience with Ryanair going from Barcelona to Budapest. The flight was delayed by around 3 hours due to reasons I wasn't told. This has caused spending an extra overnight stay at Budapest with hotel and transport expenses from my own pocket and booking a new flight the next day. Because the flight was delayed by so much I have lost my connecting flight for which I had a 2 hour layover window. No desks were operating when I got to Budapest at around 23:00. Received no apology or guidance at the time of the need. Disappointing experience being a frequent Ryanair flyer. Caused me a lot of problems. I have filled the Ryanair form and also sent an additional query. Have not heard back for almost a month now.,0,1.0

"I seriously thought we would never get home safely ... but that was not the only terrible part! After a nice week of vacation we take a Ryanair flight from Porto to Milan, estimated duration: about 2 hours (?). We are almost to our destination but we are told that we cannot land because of a thunderstorm. Result: we stay for more than an hour and a half suspended in the sky amid black clouds, lightning and thunders at close range. After that we are told that it will not be possible to land in Milan, so they take us to another airport (without telling us which one, except once we land!). We finally land in Genoa, tired but glad to be on land. Another hour and a half of waiting and we are told that we will be departing again? In the meantime, no one offers us water, food, but the captain tells us that we have ""permission to contact family and relatives,"" if we desire. In the meanwhile, we contact our hotel to alert them to the uncertainty of the situation; they unfortunately warn us that it will not be possible to check in in the middle of the night (it was midnight by then). We arrive at Milan Linate and manage to catch the last shuttle to downtown Milan, where we squeeze into the first hotel next to the Central Station, in order to make as little distance as possible at midnight with baggage and personal belongings. Bewildered but exhausted and thus resigned, we pay three times the price of the hotel originally booked, which did not allow us to have a refund because of the short notice. Finally, once back home we decide to pursue a refund request (end of July 2022), promptly rejected because EU261 regulations do not provide for refunds due to ""unforeseeable"" conditions. We call support again, who suggests we ask for compensation instead of a refund (August 2022). In September 2022 I submit the request, in October 2022 I receive no response (waiting time described by the site for processing the request: 10 days), and decide to call the client support again. The operators, as always rude and annoyed, say they will send a reminder. I have no words for the incompetence of this company, their treatment of passengers (leaving them without water, food, explanations) is absolutely inhumane.",0,1.0
"It all started what now seems a lifetime ago when sitting enjoying the sites of Lisbon City centre when my partner checked the Ryanair app out of mere curiosity to find our flight was delayed by over 3 hours. Inconvenient yes, but perhaps we could enjoy a few extra hours before heading to the airport? A quick chat with customer services should easily tell us if that's OK or whether we must be there for the original departure time.  After 20 minutes of fighting the customer service chat feature we gave up. A completely automated response to all questions, none of which related to the query at hand. Fast forward to the airport - the main terminal looks nice but we get shuttled off to the budget terminal.  Past security, not fun but not the fault of Ryanair at least. The delay is over 4 hours now so a quick search online shows we are entitled to food and drink. Best find a member of their helpful crew who will be happy to help! A walk of all the gates though provides slim pickings .. perhaps they don't want to help the people from the growing list of flights being delayed? When we did track down a member of staff at a gate, we were  ushered through a gate to a Ryanair desk that could help, only to find on going through the door that it was a one way trip - back to the initial check-in slaughterhouse. I feel by this point we all know what the response was at the check-in desk - go and ask at the gate of course. We tried to argue briefly. We took the tickets, we accept our fate. At least the comforting knowledge we received from the checkin desk that someone will come out and offer help from Ryanair back at the gate will keep us warm over the upcoming hours of woe. Back at the gate now. Security was even better the second time around, apparently they don't like boarding passes being used twice. When we mentioned Ryanair though they seemed to get it. Not sure how many hours to go. Perhaps a member of Ryanair will come and offer assistance at some point. Perhaps even food. Or water. Even an update on the flight that keeps getting pushed further back. We can only wait and see.",0,1.0

"Ryanair is unfailingly the most horrific airline to fly with. Appalling customer service, attracts clients because of its seemingly “cheap” tickets but there is always hidden fees somewhere. This time it was because i arrived to check in 1 hour and 45 minutes before flight instead of two hours - so got charged 30 euros. I had tried to check in for both flights at my departure destination as I knew I wouldn’t have a lot of time at the transit stop to do the check in. Bad tempered Ryan Air staff told me I couldn’t but she just seemed like she couldn’t be bothered. I then got charged 30 euros at the transit stop because I had checked in ‘late’ (even though I had tried to do it 4 hours earlier). The thing that bothers me the most though is that they advertise “free airport check in two hours before flight departure” but fail to mention that they will charge you if its less than that time, or how much they will charge you (they probably do tell you somewhere in small print but the spirit is one of being scammed). Hate this airline. Never using again.",0,0.9493252455450653

Stansted to Maastricht. Overall I had a very positive experience! Check-in was efficient and the boarding process was well managed. During this short flight the crew were efficient and hardworking.

"This review relates to a Ryanair Flight from London Stansted to Rimini in Italy on 26th July 2022. Firstly, the website is logical and well set out stating the rules and policies of the airline. Follow the rules and there are no problems. I should like to commend the Check-in staff for their help and efficiency. I took a train from London to the Stansted airport unfortunately the luggage of another passenger ripped the top of my bag. The check-in staff noticed this rip and were very helpful towards me. Boarding the flight was another matter as there was a rather large group of Italian teenagers returning home to Italy. Their chaperones were badly organised and the Ryanair ground staff did not manage this well resulting in a delay to the flight of about forty minutes. None of the ground staff showed any initiative in this situation. None of the ground staff spoke any Italian and there was no effort to translate to the teenagers.  Passengers were allowed to queue in the bridge before the flight was ready to depart. There were steep stairs to be negotiated and I assisted an elderly passenger with the stairs as no warning had been given about the stairs. The security demonstration was reasonably well conducted. Service was lacklustre with one cabin crew yawning over her passengers and rolling her eyes and looked bored. The lovely lady who sat next to me ordered a prosecco and was gruffly handed her drink and a cracked plastic glass. The drink spilled over the lady and the male cabin crew showed no interest and seemed to expect the passenger to continue drinking from the cracked plastic glass. The male staff member had to be asked to find some paper towels and to replace the glass. He sighed indignantly when asked to do so. At one stage a member of the cabin crew locked the lavatory and caused a line to form. There was no apology or explanation either. The landing was fine but disembarkation was chaotic and poorly managed. Based on this experience, I would think twice about booking with this airline again. The ground staff were superb, friendly and polite and very helpful. Their professionalism was let down by the cabin crew.",1,1.0

"Arrived at the airport after a busy couple of days. Didn’t have time to check-in online as we tried doing it but you had to go through multiple different steps that if you’re not tech savvy don’t make a lot of sense. We were shocked to find out that to get our boarding passes you had to pay 55euros each to receive a hand written paper boarding pass with your name and info. We booked together and were not seated next to each other. Then when we asked if we could sit next to each other they tried to charge us an additional fee. To top it all off, after running around to different desks and getting handwritten boarding passes, we then found out that one of us allegedly hadn’t paid for a 20kg cabin bag, when both of our receipts showed that we had. They refused to believe that we both had and made us pay 50euros again for a bag that we had already paid for.

Paid a lot of money for these flights and was late both ways. The plane coming back was so hot and uncomfortable and nothing to rehydrate for many passengers either as I got the last bottle of water 20 passengers into service. No paper in the toilet and a surly and jaded looking set of flight attendants. Landed at 2.05 am and had a long wait for baggage also. Didn't actually get out of the airport til after 3am. We had to book priority boarding if we wanted to bring 10kg carry on bags and guess what, everyone was released and boarded all at the same time in a herd like way.

"My flight on 1/7/22 from Lisbon to Luxembourg was canceled while we were already on board. After disembarking the crew told us to go to the help center to rearrange our flight. I asked where our luggage was and they had no idea and they were completely lost.

I asked them to give me what they offer in writing as proof from my employer as long as to request a reimbursement from the insurance company. I had bought insurance coverage through Ryanair's application. They refused to give me what I asked and they gave me a paper with the links to request a refund in case I didn't want to fly in 5 days and to open a request to Ryanair's help center to provide me the evidence of the cancellation and the alternative options they offered me. I also asked why they didn't give us the paper while we were waiting for so many hours in the queue to read our rights and decide without waiting for so long, and they replied ""we don't know"". I paid for the hotels and I opened a ticket on 2/7/22. Until today 15/7/22 I have not received any feedback although I sent two reminders telling them that I have to provide the requested docs to my employer and to the insurance company. The plane crew, the ground service, and the help desk were completely unable to manage the situation.",0,1.0
"Every time I've travelled with Ryanair something unexpected happens and I always end up paying for something that I imagine was included in the ticket that I have already purchased, because the info given is so minimal. It's almost as if they don't tell you the information so that you pay more when you reach the gate. I booked an around trip and on my departure to Corfu and my bags went through the system smoothly and without any concern, but then on my flight back home, with the same exact priority that I had on my first departure they tell me that my bag is too big and I have to pay extra for it. The girl at the check-in did not say anything about me having to pay even extra at the gate, and I was not the only one that went through this process. Not only did I have to pay extra, the Ryanair personnel at the gate were very rude and gave me and others attitude. And to top it off, the flight was just as expected by me, late. We had to stand outside for 40 minutes while the large jets were testing their engines. I could go on but I won't. All in all a very disappointing experience. The ""cheap"" flight ticket ended up costing as much as what a decent flight company would charge.",0,1.0
Worst airline ever. Rude and disrespectful staff. Definitely the biggest fraud company they try to take your money in any possible way. Always late never on time.

"Even bearing in mind that this is a low cost airline, there are things that should not be tolerated. The agents at check-in counters were outright abusive. One of them, looked at my passport, saw Ukrainian nationality in it and asked for a Covid test. I was fully vaccinated and at this time the requirements on Ryanair website was either full vaccination or a test. I showed all my proofs of vaccination and a self-test, but she kept demanding that I do a test at the airport worth GBP 40. I pointed out the requirements on the website were different and then she said “one more comment and you are not flying”. I took the test, spent money and 90 minutes waiting for the results, and returned to the check-in. By then there was another agent at the counter, she said I didn’t need the test and proof of full vaccination would do. I returned to speak to the first staff member, but she yelled at me in front of other customers calling me rude and saying that she refuses to “serve me” in any circumstances. I contacted Ryanair multiple times after, bringing this situation to their attention, they did not answer. My experience with Ryanair this February was appalling, and I recommend to avoid flying with this airline at all costs.",-1,0.0

Upon arrival at the airport they wanted me to pay an additional ""musical instrument"" fee for my guitar after I had already paid an additional fee to carry it on the plane. We explained this fact, but were treated horribly by the service desk, and made to either buy a separate seat on the plane for my guitar or pay this additional fee. They claimed that the case would not fit in the overhead bins, but it clearly would.  They also booked off-site Parking and upon our return from the trip, the parking attendant did not show up at in the airport to pick us us and was unreachable by phone after 4 attempts. We ended up having to take a Bolt car over to the parking lot and were then verbally attacked by the parking attendant who was angry that we used WhatsApp to call him instead of regular phone line to reach him. No apology for our difficulty in reaching, said ""we made a mistake"" when clearly they had not showed up as stated in their instructions.",0,1.0

"After Ryanair had cancelled my flight to Prague just 1 day before the flight, I was forced to place another booking for over £340 to make sure I was able to travel, I couldn't take the risk. After the trip I'd spoken with an agent and they agreed to process a refund excluding the extra for booking through a third party. They lso advised that I would receive my refund within 1 week.  I chased this up another 5 times throughout April, May & June. Every time, the agents said it was a processing error & the money would be paid within the next week and it never was. When I requested a confirmation email, each agent has told me this is not possible.  After speaking to an agent today (we are now in July), the agent has again confirmed that Ryanair will be processing the booking fee and nothing else.  After speaking with an agent on the phone today; I have been advised that I will receive a confirmation email that my refund has been processed, something I have been denied before. The agent also advised me that payment may take up to 28 days. This is another 28 days on top of the 60+ days since Ryanair advised that I would receive my payment in the next week.

"Ryanair is the worst airline ever, I do not even recommend this to my biggest enemies. We were supposed to fly at 8.35 to Marseille. We got through security and we waited for the gate to open. But suddenly our flight info disappeared from the display, it said that there is no gate open for it. After 10 min. they tell us that the flight has been cancelled and that we must leave the airport immediately. They didn't give us any reason or any compensation for it. They destroyed our family vacation. So now we can't do anything about it and we must accept that Ryanair won't get us there. After a few hours, we were told that the plane just didn't arrive. When we tried to get a refund for the tickets, they told us they will give us only one ticket, because the flight back technically didn't get cancelled so they won't give us the money back. With that said, the lesson learn is to never fly with companies like Ryanair!",0,0.9767335458040244
"Don’t be fooled by the affordable prices. You will end up paying way more than expected. They charge $30 Euros to check you in and print your boarding passes, they charge a lot if your bag is overweight. They allow carry on bags but they must be super small in size. If you are traveling from the US and the carry on is a good size for other airline standards, it will be too big for this airline, therefore you will need to send it as a checked bag for an extra price. They have so many ways of making you pay a lot at last minute at the airport. Will never fly with Ryanair again.",0,1.0

"My husband bought a round-trip ticket Tel Aviv-Berlin. At the beginning, the flight was delayed for several hours, and then, instead of Berlin, the plane landed at 2 AM in Hannover. Then a fabulous show began: the pilot, upon landing, announced that the passengers had nothing to worry about and a bus to Berlin would be organized. As a result, the passengers were denied a bus to Berlin / hotel - they were abandoned late at night at the airport in other city at a time when public transport does not work. In addition, passengers flying with luggage were left without it, as the luggage was sent to Berlin. And now Ryanair sent me an ""Apology for the flight delay"". No, Ryanair, we don't accept your apologies for the ""flight delay"". This is not the provision of the declared services we paid, which caused a significant financial and moral damage.",0,1.0

"Firstly, as a member of staff at the airport I must say, I hear alot of bad things about Ryanair but let me tell you as someone who meets many passengers and works close to the action, my knowledge about Ryanair at Manchester Airport is huge. There isn't much room for a person who is overweight in 1 of Ryanair seats, they'll probably be uncomfortable for the whole flight, especially next to the window. Ryanair use Terminal 3. It's a no smoking terminal. Ryanair quote, ""low fares"", but they mean the starting price is a low fare. It soon adds up to cost just as much as easyjet or jet2. When you board or come off a Ryanair flight you'll find it's always up/down the steps not through the airbridge. When you're waiting for your suitcase. Expect to be waiting for at least 1 hour and 30 mins. Otherwise you might loose your mind and take it out on the wrong member of staff....like me. On our way home from Rome we arrived at the airport, got through security. I decided to check my phone to see where the plane was using Plane Finder. The answer to my question....Manchester. It had literally just taken off. We left nearly an hour late. During the flight we were told no food or drink available. Imagine if we purchased an inflight meal. We arrived at Manchester but spent 3 hours waiting for our bags because Swissport must've only had 3 people unloading each Ryanair flight. So we were 1 of 3 flights landed. For 3 planes there is a maximum of 3 baggage handlers. I know this because the baggage handler told me. I decided to ask him what abuse he was getting from a passenger who landed with me that day. Good luck if you book Ryanair.",0,0.9661155522609997

I gave up after 3 weeks of trying and just booked new flights at double the cost of original flights. We are home 3 weeks and still trying to get a refund. Absolutely shocking. Never again. Better to pay a little extra and fly with a reputable airline, get decent comfortable seats and not ripped off either by overpriced food and drink. Cabin crew require new uniforms!

I was trying to reach the customer support service and call them, but no one picked up the phone! At the airport, there was no one at the Ryanair desk to help it just was empty. When we eventually got onboard, the pilot announced that the reason for the delay was that they simply did not have a plane for the flight and they waited for it to arrive from somewhere else! Moreover, when we got onboard the seats were dirty because they did not have enough time to clean them after the previous flight. On top of that, our return flight was also delayed.

"Apart from horrendous queues at Birmingham (not Ryanair's fault), flights both ways (operated by Malta Air, a subsidiary of Ryanair) were excellent. Ground staff and flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The planes were clean and our seats (we paid a bit extra for exit seats) were roomy. We do not normally buy food on board, but as the return was a lunchtime flight, we bought a sandwich and drink, which were, respectively, hot and cold and were very reasonably priced. Flights both ways were more or less on time. I see the less positive comments from other travellers, but I have flown Ryanair many times and the rules are clear - as long as you follow them, you shouldn't receive any nasty surprises.",1,1.0
"When you consider all the extra fees this airline is not value for money at all. From now I will avoid this airline at all costs and recommend everyone to do the same. Their customer service is the opposite of what customer service should be. If you do not wish to pay an extra fee for check-in, you need to do it online 24 hours before the flight. However if you try to do it 2 hours before the flight, it is already closed and you need to check in at the airport and pay an extra fee of 55 Euros per person at the counter. Forcing customers to pay extra fees that are higher than the actual ticket! For a service that takes their employee 2 minutes. That's down right scammy in my opinion. We didn't even get seats next to each other even though we paid that fee. I had the same on another flight when checking in online, unless you pay extra online, you will be systematically assigned random seats not next to each other. The seat my partner had had a free seat next to her, still I was seated somewhere else because I didn't pay extra.",0,1.0

"Upon queuing at the gate, one of the check-in staff started making her rounds handing out pieces of paper and asking questions to passengers. She made a b-line towards my mum and I and out of the blue said our bags had to go in the hold. For a second I couldn't believe it. These are the same bags and same size and weight we used going up from Malta. So much so that I am thorough with travelling light and my mother's bag in particular is a Ryanair approved sized wheelie bag. To prove a point the lady at the check in placed it in the sizer which fit perfectly only to tell us that it's above the line! I thought to myself this is a joke. In the meantime a quarter of the other passengers in the non prio line had bulky rucksacks twice the size of our bags which would have never fit in the sizer. I paid the 90 odd euros for this thieving act and vow to never use Ryanair again.

"Manchester to Torp which was booked with airport counter check-in included, the «Plus» ticket option. Hence, it should be safe to assume that the counter check in is available and working. We arrived nearly 2 hours before departure and spent 1,5 hour in a queue waiting to be checked in together with lots of other people. 2 counters only were open, which obviously was insufficient. We asked a Ryanair representative if it was possible to speed up the process, but she was only interested in lecturing us and questioning why we had not used the net check in, rather than doing something to speed things up so people didn´t lose their flight. She might well be right that this is a better option but in our situation that is totally beyond the point. No actions taken, nothing done, just a shrug. We managed just about to arrive gate on last and final call just to be stuck in an unventilated corridor with all the other passengers for 25 minutes before boarding started. The flight itself was what we expect from Ryanair; it works and gets you there. Crew was smiling and positive. Hence 2 stars, not 1. Ryanair has a considerable attitude problem.

Eventually the front door was re-opened and passengers with babies that looked very unwell due to unbearable heat were taken to front for air.

We got to the plane around 9:20 pm and they informed us that due to the bad weather we need to wait more. After half an hour they said they’ll depart in 1 hour. They didn’t let us off the plane either. So basically we didn’t have any choice but being prisoned in the plane until the weather is ok. When that will be?

All Ryanair staff we dealt with were polite and helpful, couldn’t fault them at all so will certainly use them again. Only reason I don’t award full marks was because on the outward flight cabin crew made toilets at the front of the plane for crew only so everyone had to use the back and with the catering trolleys in the aisle for most of the flight it made for some very uncomfortable passengers, no such problem on the return flight.",1,0.9153411038426144
"Leeds to Majorca. My experience was absolutely horrendous. We paid for fast track from Leeds - Majorca - Valencia - Majorca - Leeds. This was a waste of money as we stood in line which was slower than the normal queue at Leeds Airport. On our way back from Majorca we were seated in the waiting area and approached by one of the staff who demanded to see our boarding pass. We showed her the boarding pass and she immediately demanded that we follow her to the desk. She told my nephew that he had a non-priority ticket and said ""I need your credit card."" When he asked why, she said he had another case and needed to pay £45 now or else he could not fly. She and her colleague seemed to feel proud of the way she had put us on display embarrassing us in front of everyone else who had now lined up behind us. We were being stared at angrily as it seemed we were holding up the queue. I thought I had paid for priority tickets as I paid for fast track and selected seats. I showed them the icon on my Ryanair account after logging in and the responded saying they didn't know what that was. They had to call someone on the phone as my nephew who is American provided an Amex card. They kept us at the desk in front of everyone who thought we were holding up the queue for more than 10 minutes. I asked and they wouldn't give me any more information. Eventually, my nephew got his passport and his boarding pass back and they started embarking. They asked us to wait even though I had paid for fast track and we were already at the front of the queue. They deliberately kept us there and let us board after I became upset. When we boarded we were confronted by the flight attendant who told us that the cabin bag we had just paid for needed to be in the cargo bay even though it's smaller than normal cabin cases. I advised them we had paid and pointed at the tag which was snow taped to the bag and she insisted that we should have been told to put in cargo. I tried to explain that they didn't tell us and we wouldn't know that as we don't work for the airline. She put her hands up in my face cutting me off and stating that its the airport and not the airline and she doesn't work for the airport. I advised that we don't work for the airport either. She agreed for us to have our case in the overhead compartment but stated that should it fill up, it would need to go in the cargo area. We watched as cases bigger and heavier than my nephews were placed in the overhead compartment with no argument. I have never been so embarrassed as I have with Ryanair and will never fly using Ryanair ever again. I will tell anyone who will listen to what happened and never fly Ryanair again.

Boarding experience for elderly people with mobility issues and medical assistance is awful. Priority boarding is meaningless and the big strong or pushy people just push older or frail people out of the way. The process of providing medical waiver letters a day before departure is also very stressful as this leaves no leeway for if there are issues and people may not be able to print these letters if they find digital technology difficult. Staff should help people with medical needs to board early and assist them on the plane. Also staff allowed groups of men to remove their masks on the plane putting everyone at risk.

We weren't allowed to put our backpacks in the overhead storage bins due to corona but it's fine for hand suitcases to go in there and to sit in a seat that's dirty with dirty marks on the window and the side of the window. We had a return flight and sat in the same plane going to Italy and back again to Finland.. Same dirt as when we flew the first time. There's also no space for you to put your dirt in the front seat and the trays are at a angle that whatever you put on there slides down and the seats are so upright you can't sleep.,-1,0.0
"The last time I am ever going to fly with them. When arriving at the airport for check in, there was only one member of staff on the relevant desks and so a lengthy wait was needed before we got to speak to them. By the time we did speak with them, she informed us that we had just missed the check in period and each ticket was now to be charged £55 in order to check in. The total of £110 was as expensive as the actual flight tickets, if not more. The late check in was primarily due to the understaffing at the Ryanair counter at Stansted and not to any poor time keeping or organisation on our part. After reluctantly paying this extortionate fee (what other choice did we have?), we then proceeded through security and on to our gate. Once we boarded the plane however, there was than a 1 hr 45 min delay to our flight where we sat on the tarmac and waited. Having been charged £110 just moments earlier for being late and then being delayed for almost 2 hours really angered me. The late check in fee was entirely unnecessary and immensely overpriced in the first place, but what with our flight being delayed, it then also proved to be completely redundant. It seems that I was deemed late and charged, but they can be four or five times as late as I was deemed to be and get away with it.",0,1.0
We were travelling with our 1yr old baby. We could not check-in online for some reason. We arrived at the airport 2h10 before but time to queue (very long queue) we arrive at the desk 1h30 before the flight and then we had to pay 110 euros for manual check-in (for what is this 55 euros fees I don't know but does not seems fair). Then we queue (again very long queue at the security check-in) and we run to get to the gate. There someone says we only have a FFP2 masks and need a FFP3 mask. Anyway we just want to get on the flight so we go to buy some FFP3 masks at the nearby shop (which actually are FFP2 but much more thick). We are then allowed to enter the flight and noticed that all of the Ryanair employees on board have a simple mask (same as we had before we were refused). Flight was okay even though the seats are really uncomfortable. Thank god it was only 1h30 flight. Anyway last time I fly with them. I prefer to pay 300 euros more and not have to go through all this.,0,1.0
"My wife, myself and our three daughters age 3,5&9 flying back to uk from Faro. My youngest daughter had an accident in the departure lounge and we ended up missing the 20 minute deadline to board the plane by 3 mins. The irony being we’d been sat in the departure lounge waiting for the flight to board for over 30 mins. There was no way they would let us on the plane and they ceremoniously told us this in front of 300 people flying on the adjacent flight. My wife and eldest daughter in tears. My youngest not sure what’s going on. All in all 10 hours later we got back to the UK, Stansted instead of Birmingham. We hired a car at 1am in the morning and drove home to Gloucestershire. I drove to collect my car from Birmingham airport the next day. £900 mistake overall. Ryanair charged us £500 of that just to adjust the 5 tickets regardless of age. The one saving grace was the good will of the passengers that moved their seats to help us sit together. My distain for this airline can only be described in words I can’t possibly write in this review.",0,0.9171687940610963
"Regular Ryanair customer. Flew back from Alicante on Friday 18 th March 2022 into Shannon. Perfect flight and landed 15 minutes early. But wanted to commend a few things. The cabin crew were excellent, very professional. The landing was so smooth I didn’t realise we where on the ground. But I do wish to single out the senior flight attendant. I was carrying some duty free as well as my 10 kg case which was heavy. The steps off the plane were steep which normally I’ll cope with. But I asked this young man if I could leave my case till I get down the steps and then come back up and get it. Not at all he said I’ll take down for you. He was a gentleman. I thanked him and he said it was his pleasure. One final thought it was the first time I heard senior cabin crew thank his colleagues for their help and hard work during flight. Nice touch I thought. I know this man was not Irish but thanked the passengers for flying Ryanair in Irish. Excellent. To be commended. Well done Ryanair customer service.",1,1.0
"This was the first time I have flown with Ryanair for years, after previous bad experiences, and I only flew as it was part of a package deal. It’s not that much cheaper than other airlines, which would give a better experience. The boarding process was the worst I have ever experienced. We were second in the priority queue and ended up, passing through the gate and waiting at the bottom steps waiting for a bus for ages, then we were one of the first to board the bus. We then had to wait on the bus at the bottom of the aircraft for ages, and when we got off the bus, surprise surprise we were now much further from the front. This is Ryanair priority boarding. Pretty much everyone on the flight had priority boarding, but it only gets you priority onto the bus. This is not really priority. The staff were very good, the food offerings were poor, and the seat is bolt upright, with no adjustment, and no storage. The seat is only really suitable for an hour or two flight, not four hour’s. We were at the furthest possible gate in Tenerife, and arrived into the furthest possible gate in Dublin. This is typical of Ryanair. The ultimate in no frills.",1,0.5218767677520096
"Worst customer service experience I have ever had. We arrived an hour and a half before departure and went to check in. Ryanair only had two employees. One member of my company and I were denied our COVID certification due to a difference in Italian rules we were unaware of, which was fair, except we were leaving the country to go to the UK where we were in line with the rules. Regardless the staff sent us to the basement to buy a COVID rapid test. Within 20 minutes we were upstairs again with our results, but the two employees had closed the check in counter, after they had told us to run downstairs to get a test and then come back for our boarding passes. We couldn’t get our passes online because it directed us to the ticket counter, but the ticket counter had stranded us. The rest of our party had headed through security while we got our tests and approached the Ryanair staff on that side and told them our dilemma. They told us to obtain our boarding passes online, which we couldn’t do because it directed us to the ticket counter. They told us we had to book new flights because no one was at the check in counter. We were early enough we would have made the flight had someone been at the check in counter to simply print our passes (as we had checked in online). Our party members talking with the employees at the gate talked with them for 50 minutes trying to get them to send someone to log in but they refused. During that conversation we informed the Ryanair representatives that one of the stranded members was prone to seizures and was out of their medication (which was in England. They simply hadn’t brought extra) and needed to be on the flight to get her medication. The staff was unresponsive, with the manager also refusing to get our passes and when told about the seizure situation was told that if they seized “we would have to take them to a hospital”. After no help those of us that were stranded found a hotel and arrived there before the flight took of, as it departed 50 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Absolutely the worst experience. We will never fly Ryanair again.",-1,0.0

"Beware of the latest scam - 3rd party services booked on the Ryanair website: I was flying from London to Malaga and, when I purchased extra hold luggage the day before I flew, I decided to, at the same time, also buy a ticket for National Express from Victoria coach station to Stansted airport. I did so and paid one amount on my credit card, but I received no confirmation of the National Express booking, so I called NE and they had no record of my booking or payment. I did so again the next morning - still no record, so I had to buy the ticket again at a higher price. I tried to call Ryanair, but could not get through to them, nor had any success with their ""live"" chat. After arriving in Malaga I tried to get a refund from Ryanair, whom I had paid, but they said that I needed to get this from NE and that it had nothing to do with them as NE were a third party service provider. All my explanations that I had paid Ryanair and NOT NE were ignored. So I called NE again and they still said that they had no record of the reservation or payment, so I had to make a claim against my credit card company for a refund. All this took several hours of my time and was incredibly stressful. It was a relatively small amount, but I was incensed by Ryanair's approach and determined to get my money back. They are truly shocking in their customer service.  Only fly with them if there is NO alternative, even if other airlines are more expensive. Only buy the most basic/cheapest ticket and only upgrade or buy extras (seat choice, hold luggage, food, etc) as late as possible and just before your flight - in case there is a change of plan or cancellation, then your refund amount is much lower. Never purchase 3rd party services from their website - car rental, coach travel, hotels, etc. If there is a problem then they will screw you. I hope that this will help others to not make the same mistake in future",0,0.8647821960773866

"We are originally from Singapore & arrived in Frankfurt on Dec 15, 2021. We had booked a Ryanair flight to travel from Frankfurt to Catania on Dec 17, however, on Dec 16 we received news that the Italian govt has imposed an entry restriction on leisure travelers who had been in Singapore within the last 14 days. Since we suddenly became unable to enter Italy, we had to remain in Germany for the rest of Dec & cancel our trip to Catania. We tried to cancel our Ryanair tickets for flight FR 1558 and request for a refund for 321.96 € on Dec 16 but to no avail. We are very disappointed and what’s worse is I was told by Ryanair that its refund policy does not cater for flights that are not cancelled by the airline but I could pay 180 € to change my tickets before the flight took off on Dec 17. Since we will not be in Europe after Dec to use the new tickets, a refund would be the only feasible option. It has been extremely troubling & thoroughly stressful for us since Ryanair wouldn’t try to help us with the refund.",0,1.0

"There is no word in the English language that can fully describe how bad this airline is. I’ve had my shares of bad experience with Ryanair but always thought “Well, my bad I should have been more prepared I guess” or “they are probably having a bad day, cut them some slack” etc. But if you’re going to be aggressive and verbally abusive to two senior travelers, then we’re going to have a real problem. Even more if the seniors in question are my parents who have a limited knowledge of English. My parents came to visit us this weekend. They arrived in London fully prepared, vaccinated, passports, forms, VeriFly app literally everything that was required and asked of them. They flew in with BA at Heathrow and everything went smoothly (take some notes Stansted!). Then we prepared their return journey and they made sure to book 2 handbags (that’s how it works now you have to pay for handbags too). So, prior to the trip they booked two ‘less than 10 kg handbags’ on the agency’s website which gave them also the right to priority board (something they were not aware of). They actually waited and queued until it was time to board and once in front of the person at the desk were asked to pay £90 for the two bags. My dad tried to explain he already paid for it, but she didn’t want to hear it, she laughed to their faces because they tried to explain themselves with the few English words they know, and then she realized that my dad speaks Spanish (apparently, she did too) so they managed to understand each other to some extent. She lost patience and told my parents it was either they paid for the bags, or they had to leave them behind. Scared and tired by the situation they decided to pay and after they got the confirmation and the sticky tag on their bags asked if they could get an invoice or receipt. The lady said she didn’t have it and that they will receive it by email. However never confirmed it with my dad and asked them to quickly move towards the plane and embark. Then someone - I'm guessing who's a security person - yelled at them in the corridor in English (remember a language they don't understand) and kept screaming and shouting at them for a good minute without thinking they might not be able to understand his language. Literally no patience, no kindness, no respect. My parents managed to connect the dots and gathered that he wanted them to leave the bags outside the plane (remember small handbags less than 10 kg) they pointed a corner to him, and he let out some kind of agreeing grunt. Then once on board they probably were thinking they could finally relax, but no, once again someone with a lot of empathy and sympathy decided otherwise. The hostess that day kept asking my mum to remove her jacket, and put it up in the overhead bin, then underneath the seat, then finally take it back and put it on her knees because it wasn’t right, and every 5 minutes came back to check if she was ""cooperating"" because she also asked my mum to remove her scarf and for some reason it needed to be left with the jacket. What is wrong in your head? When a lady of a certain age is cold, you pressure her into removing her clothes? First, I don’t get what the security hazard is with a scarf. Second, it’s literally freezing outside, and we know how cold it can be inside the plane before take-off, also ever heard of covid. I mean come on. I'm curious to know if they provide the same type of care to all their passengers.",0,1.0

I really cannot understand, what kind of a company can have a single priority: to cheat on their customers, to fool and deceive them. But that’s Ryanair! The feeling of being a victim of an air company’s fraudulent manipulations is awful, it’s like when someone steals your wallet.

"Our flight from Crete to Athens started off with online check-in issues. We followed the prompts, but there was no option for check in, only to cancel or change flight. We even watched a video but never was presented with a check in option on the mobile website. When we arrived at the airport, we spoke to one of the employees at the bag check line, and explained to her our issue with online check in. She offered no help or advice, only said there is nothing for her to do and that we must pay €55 each to print our tickets or we could speak to her coworker at a Skyserv help desk. We proceeded to the alternate employee at the Skyserv booth and once again explained our troubles with online check in. We even showed her the step by step process in which we tried to check in on our mobile phone. She started to raise her voice and said “I don’t know why you’re the only people having an issue. Other customers don’t have this issue. It’s clearly something you did wrong!” Instead of providing us with actual help and presenting a fix to the issue that we physically showed her on the phone, she was dismissive, blaming us, and outright rude. When we wished to escalate the matter, she refused to tell us her name and began acting even more erratic. She stated that “Ryanair will know who I am and I don’t have to give you any information.” At this point we were forced into making one of two decisions - miss our flight or pay €55 for each boarding pass. Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help, we returned to the bag check desk, and decided to go ahead with the payment. At our second interaction with the bag check staff, we were informed that the price per boarding pass is now €62.50! We showed them the Ryanair email that said it was €55 and explained to said staff that she told us ten minutes prior that it was a €55 fee. The employee told us to look at her screen if we have an issue, because that’s what it says and she could give no explanation for the discrepancy in Ryanair email or what we were previously told. At this point we were uncomfortably coerced into choosing to either miss our flight or pay this new arbitrary price that no employee could give an explanation for. No one can explain to us why we were unable to check in online and no one can explain to us why there was an increase in price after this entire debacle. Fast forward two months after this incident and multiple complaints to Ryanair, they finally responded with again no resolution. A representative from Ryanair emailed stating, ""At first, I would like to express our sympathy regarding the circumstances resulting in you being unable to have done the check-in online. However, if a customer does not manage to check-in online then an airport check-in fee of €55/£55 per person is applied."" This acknowledges our inability to check-in, but somehow still place the blame on the customer. When questioned about why we were arbitrary told to pay €62.50 by the bag check staff when Ryanair and this representative's email clearly stated €55, another rep responded back with, ""Unfortunately, as per the previous responses you have received, our standpoint remains unaltered that means according to our agreed Terms and Conditions Article 10.1 all monies paid towards Ryanair are non-refundable."" So again no explanation. It really feels like a ""you have to pay whatever amount we tell you or you get to miss your flight"" situation.

"Worst airline ever, I have travelled with this airline several times and what applies to a city doesn’t apply to another. It’s supposed to be considered a low cost airline but they look for every possible way to charge you, I had no trouble getting my suitcase on the flight in Madrid airport but they made me pay for it the Canary Islands, I arrived 2 minutes late for boarding today’s flight (28 minutes still for take off), a lady was just in front of me, they let her pass and didn’t let me, said they had already closed. 2 ladies stated that all flights close their doors 30 minutes before departure when we all know that’s a lie. They start boarding 30 minutes before departure. They were very rude and should not work in customer service, it is not meant for everyone.",0,0.8527421903097601

I hadn't been travelling for 2 years since covid. I used to travel a lot but always was flight 'sick'! I hate take-offs and landings and I think that the best take-offs I had in years was on my flight to London! It was smooth and neat! Pilots don't often get to be congratulated on their skills but I do believe that it takes a lot to ensure that the experience on the flight is seamless even with a couple of turbulences! So congrats to the crew for making me want to travel again despite my fears!,1,1.0
"Delays may happens but behavior of Ryanair is not customer oriented. With 3 hours of delay they sent voucher for just 4 euro meal, available only in cafes outside the departure area.

"I returned to Kyiv City (Borispol) from Cracow aboard Ryanair flight FR7262 on the evening of 11 September 2021. Owing to circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to complete the check-in process online (due to technical difficulties) prior to my departure for the airport. Arriving at the ticket counter 5 hours before the flight's scheduled departure, I approached the ticketing counter, explained my dilemma to a ticket agent, and with her able and timely assistance was able to implement a work-around on my mobile device which enabled me to eventually obtain my boarding pass. The agent was courteous and patient as she worked to sort out my problem. Ryanair's business model is predicated in hyper efficiency, so traditional ""customer service"" per se often suffers, and often results in decidedly mixed reviews from travelers. Thankfully, there are exceptions to every rule and it is my pleasure to proffer two thumbs up and a well-deserved Five Star rating for my recent experience.",0,0.7259516844823677
"Total disappointment. Flight FR9755 from Vienna to Dubrovnik on Sep 9th, 2021. Arrived 2 to 3 hrs before the flight. There was a very long line of about +100 people at the airport, so as I just had a carry on prepaid luggage I tried to check in online from home, but website was not letting me after multiple attempts. At the airport tried to find a Kiosk to check in, but there was none. Kept trying desperately online with the Ryanair app but it stated online check in was closed, almost 2 to 3 hrs before departure. I had no choice to get on that never ending like. After waiting for almost 2 hrs I finally managed to get to an agent, who was super stressed. She said I should have checked online, so she charged me USD55 per person for checking in at the airport agent.  Tried to explain that I tried countless times, even showed her screenshots. Ended up paying 55x3=165 Euros for my family of 3, and almost missed the flight due to the very long time it took to simply check the in. I will definitely never fly on that airline again.

"The most horrible airline I have ever flown in my life. First I bought my ticket thinking I could put a piece of luggage in the hold, I had a doubt so I contacted Ryanair chat who confirmed that I was entitled to a 10kg suitcase in the hold and when I arrived for check in, the agent told me no and I had to pay £35.99. I went to visit my parents in France for 3 days, following the English law, I have to do a PCR test 2 to 3 days before my departure to come back and after 2 days when I arrive on the UK soil. This is what I did, last Thursday when I wanted to board to come back home in England, the agent for the check in told me that my health pass has expired by 2 hours and that she can't check me in. I found myself alone in a city I didn't know, I had to take a taxi to go to the nearest city + take a hotel room at my expense. Also I had booked a hotel in London the night I arrived and unfortunately I lost my room. The worst day of my life even though I had made the necessary arrangements. I was in a small airport near Rodez and there was no flight to London until Sunday. The next day I had to go to the pharmacy for another test + buy a train ticket to Toulouse and then take another plane to London. In total I spent £300 because of a person at the airport who was incompetent and did not help me at all. I can swear that in these situations you feel really alone.

"I had always promised myself I’d never fly Ryanair but this time they were my only option. First up, booking and checking in etc. I found it pretty simple, I heard horror stories about people being charged ridiculous sums at checkin for boarding passes etc but so long as you read the instructions on the website you can’t really go wrong. And that’s the only positive thing I’m going to say about Ryanair. The aircraft was a new looking 737-800. On my flight out to bud from stn I was lucky enough to have an entire row of seats to myself, despite the rest of the aircraft being near capacity. Any airline I’ve flown with, in hot weather, will have the cabin a/c active for boarding. Not Ryanair. We sat in 30 degree heat for about 30 minutes with not so much as a breeze.  That didn’t really matter though, because the overhead fans were just awful. On this aircraft were recessed into the facia, so the direction couldn’t be altered. Add to that the “breeze” wouldn’t have been sufficient to blow out an already fading candle on a child’s birthday cake. I had two fans pointing vaguely in my direction, both set to full, both failing to live up to their job descriptions. The seats were they bad, narrow and with about 2mm of padding.  Now for the speedy boarding scam, I was standing in the terminal in BUD with the rest of the non speedy folk while the last of the speedy boarders had cleared the gate a good ten minutes previously. I was a little miffed up until I saw the speedy boarders all standing in a “cage” section of the air bridge (pictured) completely in air conditioned and completely open to the more than 30 degree heat. Contrast that with the regular folk who were enjoying the departure gate a/c. Both my flight to BUD and return flight to STN arrived late, yet Ryanair insisted upon playing their obnoxious fanfare. A truly horrible experience and I really hope I never have to fly with them again.",1,0.537997907933166

On the plane, although it was announced once at the beginning of the flight that masks are compulsory, about half of the passengers did not were them, but the crew seamed not to bother.

"I had positive experiences in the past with ryanair, better than other low cost. This time though I felt it's important to share. I do not recommend to buy tickets with them now in time of COVID. Ryanair promises to change your flights free of charge or extend voucher, but one week before flight. I supposed to fly to Bologna from Prague, pre condition is to have a PCR test not older than 3 days. My husband got positive and obviously we had to go to quarantine. I reached out ryanair and only option available was actually to change flights, but for every option they were charging full price extra for luggage (it's 40 euro on top of 50 I have already paid for luggage) and therefore any option I was extra I have to pay to keep tickets was way higher than to buy completely new. So I've asked if there is a way to cancel and get at least something back even through voucher to use it for other flight, but 150 euro of one ticket thrown away. But in this particular case it's cheating on clients: we are doing here tests on weekly base and you cannot predict to get Covid before flight if you were fine week before and extra nearly full charge for luggage on top is really stealing money. Now my feelings are that if I have to fly, next time I will buy tickets with someone else.",0,1.0

I have tried to fly out using another airline, two days prior to the current flight I took with Ryanair, and to my shock I was denied to fly because I didn’t have the identity card to be in the country I was flying in.  I had the test results, which were negative, the declaration form. Which I thought I was ready to go. Only because I was not a resident in Italy, I was denied. I emailed the Italian embassy as I was going back home, confused and desperate. They emailed right back and said that I don’t need a permission to enter the country. I found as well the updated info regarding flying to Italy, anyone could fly not only residents from April 7th. I then bought a new airline ticket from Ryanair. More affordable and to my surprise such a COVID 19 friendly use. For example, it has an easy access to all the forms necessary to fill in. And when you check in you upload all the forms and you are all set. All I did at the airport is to check in my big bag and go straight to the gate. I had to ask the person who checked me in if she’s going to check my documents and forms. She said no, because they have them all online as I submitted them. And the COVID test that I took on April 6 was still valid on 11th April and I didn’t have to take another one. I still did, and spend £300 in total.

"I use to fly between Germany and Spain about 20 roundtrips a year, usually on Ryanair. I consider Ryanair's product to be well suited for my needs. Just a seat, no frills, low price, easy way to get from A to B. Nevertheless within the last weeks Ryanair has started to arbitrarily cancel flights due to a low load factor. Somehow I understand this, when there is a sudden change in government rules and people just stop buying tickets. But now Ryanair just cancels whatever flight, that was offered a few weeks ago, just because their load factor is too low for their needs. This happened about two weeks ago and I had to rearrange my travelling, throwing away a couple of tickets from the 8 flights I had already booked with Ryanair. Now they do the same thing once again and my travel plans are totally screwed. From the few flights Ryanair offers, they just cancel whatever flight they want to, obviously without compensation. Therefore I strongly advice to NOT book any Ryanair flight, unless there is normal travelling available maybe in spring 2022.

"Ryanair gave a promotion of no fees to change a flight, so I booked my flight on the 10th September, to fly on 3rd October to 13th October. Unfortunately, the Government put travel restrictions (for Poland) as 14 days quarantine on arrival to UK after the holiday (activated from 4 am, 3rd October). I could not manage to get 2 weeks extra holiday, so I changed my mind and I tried to explain this to 4 customer service agents (from 11 am to 4.30 pm), they showed to me their standard rule is a 7-day change rule and did not let me change my ticket date with fees free promotion. They said - I can only change my ticket before 7 days prior to the flight. They are not a legitimate company, there are so many hidden fees. I paid for my tickets (3 people) 203 GBP with parking, but to change my ticket, they asked me to pay 350 GBP (appx.) including seat booking, extra baggage, everything I have to pay again even though I haven’t used anything. Also, they got my money for parking 10 days into a long stay, but they said they are not responsible to deal with my parking at all. So, why do Ryanair people keep scamming people like this. My suggestions to everyone, please stay away from this budget airline, they have got tonnes of hidden fees. My experience is - if you give them your money and you want to change anything, they will rip you off. So, be careful, ignore Ryanair at any cost, nothing is free with them.",0,1.0

"Ryanair totally mislead with bookings while Coronovirus is going on. Says you can cancel and rebook at no extra cost but totally misleading. Try to change booking and you are charged a great deal more. I booked to go September 2020 to Malaga but with government changes and so therefore not covered with insurance it was to dangerous to go. My friends booked Jet2 and were refunded straight away. I will not book Ryanair in future and I fly 3/4 times a year, now Jet2 has my business in future and I do not think I will be the only person deciding this.",0,1.0
"Earlier this year I booked a return flight from Paphos to Stansted. One sector was cancelled and I was offered a free rebooking. With the onset of the pandemic I rebooked for September. The system would not let me rebook just the one sector and charged me a rebooking fee for the sector which had not been cancelled. Fast forward to today; flight back from Stansted cancelled; offered free rebooking. Assured repeatedly on the Ryanair app that the rebooking fee would not be charged at the end of the process. Surprise surprise! I was charged the rebooking fee for the outbound flight, which I had not changed. Moral of the story is to make each sector under a separate booking. Or choose another airline.",0,1.0

"The worst customer service ever especially in Poland. Arrived to Poland with two paid cabin bag (have been travelling with the same bags for the past no of years) but on my return apparently one of those bag was ""too big"" and I was asked to pay double to take it on board. Extremely rude staff. Have never experienced such bad customer service. Not to mention that Ryanair owns my money for 4 cancelled flights since March. The flight was on 29/8/20 from Modlin, Poland to Dublin, Ireland. I was ripped off and had to pay crazy money for a laptop bag. The bag was perfectly fine five days earlier while I was travelling to Poland. I hope that the operator will not survive the Covid restrictions as Ireland desperately need a decent airlines (it's a pity that Aer Lingus do not fly to all destinations).",0,1.0
"After Covid-19 I requested a refund of my money, then after a month they sent me an email saying that I got a voucher and if I want a refund I need to ask for it. I didnt ask again since I had already asked for a refund and the request was accepted. Now on August I find out that I was never in a queue for a refund, and their excuse is that they asked me that if I want a refund I had to ask for it! This is fraud! Now I have to wait for a refund like I just asked for it, waiting for a queue again! In addition, I bought a travel insurance for my flights, and after covid 19 cancellations, Ryannair informed me that they will refund the flight cost excluding the travel insurance cost. Their response was that because I could use the travel insurance for compensation. But then, when I asked if I can get compensation, they told me that according to the terms and conditions, I cannot get compensation for the cancellation. So they kept the insurance amount, even though there is no way to use the travel insurance! I imagine how much money they made from the travel insurance of milions of travelers that never used this travel insurance!",0,1.0
Blatantly deceiving their customers into thinking they are protected with new bookings with free amendments but it’s all lies. If you go to book the flight outright it is half the price of the flight when you are changing it to a new one. So they aren’t officially charging a change fee but it is absorbed in the new flight price. Just shady and misleading. =,0,0.7454678985268868
"This airline is an absolute disgrace, the treatment of customers is truly awful, we have had issues with 3 flights this year, I appreciate that corona virus has caused massive problems across many industries, non more so than the travel industry but the complete and utter disregard shown for its customers by Ryanair is nothing short of unbelievable. This year alone they have told a party of 7 that they could either change there flight date or receive a full refund due to a Covid related issue, we selected the refund but did not receive anything, when we contacted them again they said that they could not give a refund but could change the flights, which we then agreed to, again we heard nothing further and the flights did not change, once again we contacted them and they said that they could not change the flights and we would have to wait for a refund, after several more conversations we ended up changing the flights. These flights were booked to attend a family wedding and the revised flights had us returning early morning the day after the flight, we have logged onto the app tonight to check all the details to find that the return flight has been changed and they have not made any attempt to inform us. The return flight are now 30 minutes before the wedding was due to begin. When we were told for the second time that we would have to apply for a refund we were also told that no refunds would be paid out until the corona virus pandemic had ended. On a separate flight for the honeymoon of said wedding we have spent literally 3 full days waiting to talk to a member of the team on the live chat only to be left sat in the queue all day on each occasion. We regularly travel between Manchester and Naples to visit family and this is the only airline which flys regular direct routes between the 2 airports or I can assure you, we would never fly with this company again. I cannot express in words what a poor excuse for a company they are and my dealings with them have left me feeling that there should be much more stringent rules and regulations governing how airlines operate, I can’t think of any other business where you could change what you are selling to a customer and not be liable to pay them back in full immediately. If you have any other options for flights to any destination in the world then I would strongly recommend you take them as this company does not care for its customers in any way and will offer no help of something goes wrong with your travel plans. Words are really not strong enough to describe what a terribly run organisation this is.",0,1.0
"I have flown Ryanair 20+ times and generally felt I got what I paid for. Never again unless there is absolutely no alternative. My May 12 flight to Murcia was cancelled on April 27 (as expected). I immediately requested refund which was acknowledged saying processing within 20 working days and in my bank 5-7 working days later. It’s now August 23 and my money is still in Ryanair’s bank. It is impossible to talk to customer service, I’ve never had a reply from their online chat service (once ignored for 27 hours before I needed to use computer for something else) and the website is full lies. By contrast Jet 2 paid out promptly for a cancelled March flight. During lockdown I have made 4 flight bookings for holidays in 2o21 (ever hopeful), not one with Ryanair. Their arrogance is stunning and if they think this customer is going to forget they are wrong. They are now the airline of last resort.",0,1.0
"Ryanair has been the worst in dealing with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. I booked a flight for 3 May, and still haven't received a refund on 21 August. I get that the pandemic is hugely disrupting but other airlines are doing so much better in quickly refunding canceled flights. I haven't even heard from them since the initial email about canceling my flight. There is an update on their website about how they are doing with their cancellation backlog but it's clearly bogus. It hasn't been updated since it's creation and the things it states are untrue. In the beginning, Ryanair has been pushing vouchers on their customers who asked for refunds, and made it as hard as possible to contact them (it's still next to impossible). I guess this is exactly the case of getting what you pay for. Sure Ryanair is cheap but you have to deal with things like this. The seats are tiny.

"The whole ""possibility to change flight due to corona"" for free is a scam. In total 4 flights I purchased. 1. the first flight was cancelled, I made a claim for a refund- they got back to me after a week with a voucher instead of money return and made it impossible and difficult to get my money back, eventually I had to give up and accept the voucher. The second flight I could not change for free, I could not make decision in less than 7 days prior to flying so I missed the ""free change option"" - did not fly. The other two flights were purchased together and because of that I just could not make change only to one of the flight, only to both of them. So I did not make a change, did not fly. Totally disappointing experience. You might have gotten my 100 eur of my flights this time but you just lost a customer. Great example how not approach customers.",0,1.0

"As of June 2020 you can simply add 55 EUR to the price of a one-way flight of you itinerary that is operated by Ryanair. If you don't check-in online, you have to pay for the check-in in the airport. It is there in the conditions, so no surprise. But if you google something like ""ryanair error check in"" there are quite many people complaining about not being able to check-in online. Though there are useless advice like trying other browser and clearing browser cookies. I had seats purchased, so theoretically I was able to check-in 60 days in advance. I tried it a week in advance, several days in advance, less that 2 days but more than 24 hours in advance. Never worked. You just fill all the check-in data in the account/booking, click next and nothing happens. In the browser console network tab you can see a 500 HTTP status return for the request made when you click ""next"". It usually means that the web service encountered an unexpected error, but of course only people that have access to the system can figure out why the error happened. User interface of Ryanair web application doesn't report any problem whatsoever, just does nothing. After not being able to check-in online, had to pay 55 EUR in the airport.

Ryanair on the other hand tried to fob me off with a voucher, but in small print at the end reluctantly offered a refund. I filled in the form and sent it off. I waited and waited. Then on the 30th July I received an email from them offering me a voucher and once again right at the end in small print I could have a refund if I filled a form in again (this had a familiar ring to it.)

One day later the lockdown went in. Started searching for a flight back from that moment, only flights with stops at Madrid were possible. That seemed a greater risk than staying on Tenerife. Finally on Tuesday 17h booked a flight with Ryanair for Wednesday to Brussels, for €1700 (4 persons) At checking in it turned out it was not possible to reserve a seat. Wednesday at the airport we were treated like cattle at a far to busy gate. Afters hours in the line we got the message the plane was full. They overbooked 30-40 persons.

I understand you get what you pay for with a low cost airline and expectations have to be managed but, with Ryanair, the only realistic expectation is they are going to try and take as much money from their customers as possible while providing the lowest of standards. I mean this in terms of quality of service, customer care and even cabin crew attitudes. All bottom of the barrel low. Trying to get a refund from Ryanair is a laughable offence. It appears customers are comedians and we are merely entertaining the customer service team requesting a refund. Covid and cancelled flights are no exception in this matter.

"Bologna to Berlin. I have never been so disgusted by an airline like Ryanair. Due to corona virus in Italy things got a bit crazy, Bologna airport was overcrowded and security lines very slow. It took me 1h and 40 minutes to go through the security and I am sure it could have been even longer if I didn't put pressure to hurry up. Anyway, Ryanair didn't warn that lines were longer than usual and didn't make any announcement telling that the boarding was opening or that the boarding was closing. The gate was closed 18/20 minutes before flight departure (it is stated in their rule that this can happen, but I never experienced that). My question is can it be that in a very difficult moment such as the one in which Italy is, Ryanair decides to be even more strict and careless for his customer? I really have no words to describe how disappointed I was and how disgusted my such poor behaviour of this flight company. On top of this the employees at the desk were very rude and aggressive.

"I arrived to the airport in Rome, Ciampino and stood in line for the check in 1.5 hours before the boarding time. I was supposed to check in my luggage since I had also a small backpack and Ryanair policies do not allow the carry on of two pieces of luggage on board (the check in of this second bag was included in the ticket that I bought). While I was waiting in line (there were 50 people before me) the check in for Eindhoven suddenly closed without any announcements and I was not able to check in my extra luggage. The Ryanair lady at the counter told me that there was nothing that could be done, she told me to try and go directly to the gate and ask to make an exception so that I can bring my luggage onboard since it was a hand luggage and the check in closed without any warnings or announcements. When I arrived to the gate, another Ryanair lady told me that exceptions can not be made since internal policies obligate you to check in extra pieces of hand luggage. I tried to told her what happened but I had to pay a fee of EUR 25,00 and was not able to take the baggage on board. I was forced to hand it in before entering the plane and that was the last time I saw it being placed into the airplane hold without any damage, being perfectly intact. When I arrived to Eindhoven my luggage was returned through the luggage belt, and it was completely torn apart. I went to the damaged luggage counter to ask how to proceed since Ryanair was responsible for destroying my luggage! The lady at the counter told me that I had to fill in a complaint and then go to the Ryanair website and ask for a refund. I did everything as needed, including going to the police bureau at the airport in Eindhoven. Ryanair told me that they could not do anything about what happened except refunding me with EUR 20,00. The reason why they could not do anything about it was that, since I could not hand in the receipt of my luggage - bought some years ago - they could not make sure how much the luggage was worth, why and how on earth should one keep the receipt of a luggage that was bought years before? Ryanair does not care about its customers, neither did they in the past, nor will they in the future! If you book with Ryanair you basically pay to be treated like a beast in a cattle truck.",0,1.0

"Berlin to Kerry. Ryanair has some good deals, to be sure. But do not make even a single mistake or you will pay through the nose for it. The worst, in my opinion, is if you add a child later to your booking. You cannot simply add the child, as this would be logical. Instead, you have to book a separate adult far, all the ""pay per minute"" line to speak to someone, then pay an extra 30 euro ""link fee."" The only other option is to discard your original tickets and start from scratch. Don't let your carry ons be even a millimeter over the size limit or you'll be hit by a hefty fee. I get this is their business model, but it's a model that leave fliers hating the airline.",0,1.0
"The only way to get from Krakow to Venice or close by is to fly with Ryanair, which is usually not my first choice, but I have to be honest that this time, maybe by going with no expectations I was very satisfied. E flew out on time and the aircraft was very clean and spacious, it was a B737-900, I think not -800 or at least it was renewed. We took the bus until the plane and boarded from back door. There´s not a lot comment more about the flight as basically this 2h flight I didn´t consume any type of food or beverage’s products and neither bought anything from the in-flight duty free. Overall, by not having expectations the flight went definitely very well.",1,1.0
"Rome-Ciampino to Dublin. Very good flight with Ryanair. Priority Gate boarding seamless but then held outside in bus for 10-15 minutes whilst arriving aircraft was disembarked at another location and cleaned. Eventually brought to aircraft and briefly held again on bus until cabin crew were ready to board us. Excellent crew, very friendly, hardworking and efficient for a full flight. Some storage of bags issues were quickly dealt with. The 9pm scheduled flight departed at 9.12pm and we arrived in Dublin ahead of our scheduled 11.15pm time. The onboard crew were engaging, accommodating, prompt and worked extremely hard (particularly the two lads) on a very busy cabin service. A lot of items sold out on the outbound flight but crew were able to give great alternatives. Landing was a little hard but it was very windy in Dublin last night. All in all I was encouraged by this flight and service. I’m a reluctant Ryanair customer but based on this I would definitely choose to fly with them again.",1,0.8290034824289452

So even if you have time to check in online (like getting to the airport 2 hours before, they will not let you know), they will direct to their service check-in somewhere else, and there they will charge you more than the ticket to check-in for a boarding pass. You have the time but they will direct you to the office to check-in with their own office. Never will I use Ryanair again.",0,1.0
"Budapest to Lisbon. Last weekend was the first and last time I've ever flown on Ryanair. In a 4 hour flight, where I would've normally slept through the entire flight, I couldn't sleep for more than 10 minutes straight because various carts - with food, perfumes and various other items for sell - were passing every 15 minutes, and because of constant announcements made by the crew. When I complained to my boyfriend, a fight attendant told me, very rudely 'ma'am this is the walking cabin, it's normal for the crew to be walking up and down with carts'. Maybe in Ryanair this is normal, but certainly not in other companies. When I arrived to Portugal, it took more than an hour - 1 hour and 12 minutes to be precise - for the bags from this flight to start to arrive. Two other fights that arrived much later already had their bags delivered on our mat, while we were still waiting. When asking Ryanair employees about what was going on with our bags, they said they couldn't help us or give us any information, as they didn't know. All in all it was the worst flight of my life, and I advise anyone to spend the 20 extra euros and fly on a better company. Even other low costs such as Easy Jet are far, far better.",0,1.0
"Stansted to Seville. Worst airline ever. Charged £110 just to check-in. Apparently you have to check in 2 hours before boarding otherwise they will charge you extra money.

During the flight there were lots announcements about buying which really annoyed. Deboarding was also very slow.",0,1.0

Stansted to Fuerteventura. After all the stick this airline gets I can only say that after leaving my purse on the plane the staff at the airport were brilliant.

"Brussels Charleroi to Stockholm. Difficult job performed well in the eye of Storm Ciara. Stood out on the observation deck and saw plane after plane fail to land and perform fly arounds (including our own). Having landed, Ryanair only used the front door as there was genuine concern that the movable steps would be blown over. Ground staff kept their cool and managed to get a full flight loaded within half an hour of arriving. Take off was delayed by about 40 mins. Apart from the initial ascent, all things considered, it was a remarkably smooth flight. I can't understand people who say that they are not aware that you need to check in online. I am continually bombarded with emails and pop-ups in the days leading up the flight. At €15 each way, its like option pricing.",0,0.8217061176246817
"Eindhoven to Athens. I got no email for check in online, then when i tried to check in they said it was too soon to the flight departure and i had to pay 50 euros for check in at the airport.

"Sandefjord, Torp to Manchester. Ryanair usually delivers what they promise: to get you to your destination pretty much on time, no frills, no comfort and limited customer care. So also this time. Boarding acceptable, departure on time, seats somewhere between uncomfortable and terrible but service on board cannot be criticized. The crew was smiling, friendly and efficient. Service on board ok. No need for ground support, luckily. What I dont like with Ryanair is the booking process, it is cumbersome since they try all kinds of tricks to make you buy additional services to what you have already done, like extra legroom, insurance, car hire and hotels. Other low costs carriers, like Norwegian, don't bother you unnecessarily.",1,1.0

"Dublin to Copenhagen. Was absolutely robbed by this airline. Had an issue checking in online the night before my flight, so my partner and I decided to get to the airport 3 hours early (we were recommended to get there 1hr early, but decided to take precautions!) just in case, as we’d been warned that Ryanair is very picky. At this stage, I should also mention that my partner and I are only travelling with Carry-On backpacks (no bags to check in - this has been fine on every other airline we’ve used during our 6 week holiday). We arrived at the desk only to be rudely told that checking in at the desk will cost us €55 each, and no, there was nothing they would do about that despite my issue with their website. And then the clerk eyed our backpacks and told us to go check those in as well. I’d already checked the pricing of baggage for the airline (some budget flights ask you to pay for carry-on, but I had found Ryanair only charges €10-20 for check in baggage and nothing for small carry-on). The cost for each bag to go under the plane? €40 each. That’s almost €200, just to get on the plane! That’s more expensive than my flight was to start with! Absolutely no customer care, let alone a shred of politeness or empathy. Nobody considered listening to our problem or even explaining why it had to be this way, and instead waved us away like we were being unreasonable for being shocked and upset by losing an unexpected €200. I’ll not fly with Ryanair again, and would advise any and all people hunting for budget flights to choose Easyjet instead. I’ve had great experiences with them in the airport, and even the flight attendants and planes themselves are much, much nicer than Ryanair.",0,1.0
"Alicante to London Stansted. We flew from London on a quick weekend get away. Our flight to Alicante was okay, however coming back was hell. Alicante Airpor was shut and our airline neglected to even offer us a courtesy call or email. We had already checked out of our hotel with two disabled friends (one with Crohn’s disease and other with scoliosis) having made our way half way to the airport. We called them as a result of local gossip from the cab guy and it was only then we recurved support. We spent a further 2 hours trying to assitain what their plan B was. After much frustration they offer a flight two hours away from our current destination at the time when the flight was set to leave at 5 and had the cheek to tell us that if we don’t make it there’s nothing they can do. They didn’t even offer transfers having expressed to them that all surrounding fares have either doubled as locals were aware of the chaos and or public transport coaches and trains left at timing that would miss the flight. They even told us not to get into a cab that we informed them would charge us extortion rates. In the end we paid £400 for two cabs to take our group to the airport. As we rushed into the airport there were no Ryanair representatives for support, people waited around without refreshments or information for hours before anyone appeared to board us. When we were finally on this alternative flight we waited a further 1 hr as they proceeded to act like a passenger was missing. A deploy scam to ensure they suggest the flight took off exactly under the 3 hour delay protocol for compensation. I’m fuming and it ruined our enjoyable. Just horrible. Please save yourself the anxiety and travel with someone else.",0,0.7813986046509609
London Stansted to Bari with Ryanair. A good all round experience at a good price. I had 2 email reminders about my baggage allowance and checkin for which I used the app. Boarding a bit slow and a long wait outdoors in the cold. Flight on time and arrived early. All crew pleasant enough. Seats are ok for a 2.5 hour flight. Nothing really to grumble about. Follow the simple rules and this airline is fine.,1,0.9786610168047004

Everything went well with Alitalia and Volotea, even though my flights with them were not reimbursable. Only Ryanair has not accepted to refund my tickets, even though on its website it states it ""may reimburse tickets in case of serious illness of the passenger"". Most probably a broken leg is not serious enough for this airline.",0,1.0
"I have flown Ryanair many times in the past. I find the service excellent. They get you from A to B on time, efficiently and affordably. I have never had an issue despite travelling with Ryanair more than twenty times a year for more than twenty years. They are the number one airline in my opinion for selling you exactly what you want, in terms of priority boarding, priority seats, luggage options, etc. If you want something, you can pay for it. If you don't want something, don't pay for it. Simple enough. You can check in weeks before your flight, which means that you can print out both boarding passes at home. A lot more reasonable than airlines that make you wait until 24 hours before the flight (why?!) Most of the people I hear complaining about Ryanair don't follow the rules and then blame the airline for their own mistakes or oversights. On my most recent flight, the plane left on time and arrived on time and the staff were courteous and friendly. Nothing there not to like. Highly recommended!",1,1.0

Had to show our boarding passes a total of 5 times. There wasn’t a seating area available for the gate until after our boarding passes were scanned, and no workers would scan the boarding passes until the boarding time so most people had to inconveniently stand for over an hour. Our flight was 3.5 hours and the airline refused to even provide water unless you paid! What kind of service is that? I’ve never experienced an airline that wouldn’t provide any beverage during that length of duration. Absolutely absurd. Yet the flight attendants went around trying to sell cologne and perfume. What a joke. I will never fly with this airline again.",0,0.9399055252647539

The reason of the review is to praise the airline for their prompt action.

She said I need to pay 25 euros, I asked if it goes in the same place as the buggy and the rest of the bags and she said yes it goes in the hold.

"Worst airline for countless reasons. 1) Flight delayed by six hours. We were scheduled to depart at 6.05pm. Everyone had boarded the aircraft by 6pm, but we were told by flight attendants to disembark due to a ""technical error on the plane"". The flight was rescheduled to 12 midnight, but it eventually only took off at around 1am the next day - a total of seven hours of delay. 2) Zero accountability. Ground staff were completely clueless as to any protocol in times of delay. Worse still, for the next ninety minutes or so there was no follow up action and all passengers were just stranded at the boarding gate. We were told to ""come check back every 30 min or so"" and there was no assurance of what would be done. 3) Shamelessly tried to shirk responsibility. We were told we could make claims via the EU261 flight regulation. However when I submitted my claim, the airline had the gall to say the flight was ""delayed due to air traffic controller restrictions, which was outside of our control"", which was totally opposite of the technical errors that the air crew had stated. 4) Poorest ever customer service. I followed up with Ryanair customer service staff who had zero professionalism. He was nonchalant throughout the correspondence. The incompetence of this staff member is highlighted in the fact he redirected me to the CAA UK site despite knowing my flight had departed from Spain, and that CAA does not serve cases where the flight departs from other EU member countries. Overall, I regret booking flights from a subpar company with service undeserving of any approval whatsoever. The rock-bottom standard is paralleled by its consistently plummeting stock price. I would recommend this airline to anyone who seeks disappointment, or wishes to spend the night at the airport for any abnormal reasons.",0,1.0
"Dublin to Sarajevo via Cologne. Terrible airline to travel with all round. Cheap flights don’t offer enough incentive to deal with rude staff, uncomfortable seats and hidden fees galore. Paying 55 euro to do the most standard thing possible (which is just checking in) is completely ridiculous, at no point before flying was I told and many other people for that matter, that not checking in online will incur such an expensive fee. Everyone will end up paying the pilots directly upon entering the plane so they take off at his rate. The staff were extremely rude and unhelpful and also horribly robotic to deal with. You are left with the impression that you are cattle being herded onto a truck and that you’re lucky it’s so cheap.

Furthermore, on the plane ordered a chicken panini which came still frozen inside. Overall, would not use Ryanair again. Terrible customer service.",0,0.9577764284180054
"Glasgow to Krakow. My Ryanair experience was average for a budget airline, the trip didn’t get off to the best of starts as the plane was 15 minutes late to the gate and we boarded late as well so we were about 45 minutes late leaving, but other than that we had a decent flight with Ryanair, seats weren’t too bad but I won’t travel for any longer than 3 hours in them, cabin crew were nice and ground staff as well and as an added bonus we arrived in Kraków almost 1 hour early!",1,0.9759289475654973

"Brindisi to Stansted. Very good experience. Just follow the rules and there is no hassle.

Speedy boarding is a must if you want to take a small suitcase on board as well as a ‘handbag’. Flight on time, pleasant enough crew and a good coffee.

"Stansted to Copenhagen. Just had the worst experience with Ryanair. The app wouldn't check in both me and my friend, and even though we tried doing it both on the website and in the app, it just wouldn't work. We even had the help desk trying to sort it, but still nothing. The. We arrived at Stansted Airport, and waited forever in the luggage que, only to be told that we had to go to the information desk. So we did, another massive line that took forever. I was told I had to pay 40 pounds as I wasn't checked in, and would have to apply for a refund myself. OK, I accepted. At this time there were 20 min to the gate would close, and as I paid I was told that now it was too late, out bags couldn't be checked in and now we would have to buy another flight the next day.

"Ryanair is the worst airline, because of all their hidden costs and porous policies from ticket purchasing, to check-in, to luggage policy. The staff at the airport is next-level rude and unhelpful. My boyfriend and I purchased our tickets about a month prior to our flight (it was a returning flight from Seville to Morocco), we arrived at the airport early enough to go through check-in and drop our bags only to be told that we have 2 minutes to check-in online when their website was not even responding for us to go through with it in addition to shaky airport Internet connection that was not helpful either. We went to see the company representative at the counter only to be received with a deaf ear. The lady tells us that we have to pay a 55 euro fee per person in addition to the luggage fine that goes up to 50 euros per person per extra luggage. When we tried to ask for a way to help us because we are literally stuck at the airport, she didn't even looked like she had the slightest bit of concern for our situation or even tried to find a way to help us, or direct us to someone that could. All she said was ""you gotta take it up with customer service"" when she was sitting inside the customer service booth at the airport. I know that I should've known better about Ryanair as today was NOT the first time a situation like such happened with them. I would never ever recommend this airline to anybody, you're better off paying the extra 20 or 30 euros to fly with a proper airline with an actual customer service, a real 21st century company that truly cares about their customers.",0,1.0

"Athens to Santorini. We did not have a good experience with flying on Ryanair. When we landed in Athens from the US we tried to go the desk to check in for our flight to Santorini four days later. However, the airline said it was too early and we could do so later. When we arrived for our flight we were told because we missed our window to check in (48 hours to 2 hours before the flight - we were there 1 hour and 55 minutes before) we would have to pay 60 euros each. We explained that they woudn't let us check in previously and they said they had sent us an email. We were on vacation and had taken a break from media. The staff was not kind or thoughtful, they just handed us a bill for 120 euros and sent us to another desk to pay if we still wanted to make the flight we had already purchased. To say the least we were quite upset about paying double for our flights that we had booked several weeks prior. When we left Santorini we had similar problems. The desk agent asked us for printed boarding passes. When we told her we didn't have access to a printer at our Air BnB she said it would be 30 euros per person to get a boarding pass. We could not believe that we were asked once again to pay more money on top of our ticket prices just to print out a boarding pass. She was unfriendly and handed us a ticket to go pay our bill. We asked if there was some other way around this and she said that if we wanted to step out of line and download the app. that was an option. So, even though we had been in the line since early that morning we stepped out of the line and downloaded the app. even though we really did not want this app on our cell phone. What a run around. To say the least, we will not be flying this airline again. It was such a disappointment. At least if they had been friendly that would have helped.",0,1.0
"Dublin to Berlin. Without doubt the worst airline I have ever flown with. Firstly my first flight was cancelled and this was very poorly communicated and I then had to fly from a different country. This should have started the alarm bells ringing of what lay in store. The seats were cramped, the flight attendants were clueless and the pilot must have been under supervision.

"Madrid to Bari. It wasn’t the best experience I’ve ever had flying on a flight, but this being Ryanair, you’d expect that. As many Ryanair flights fly out of Madrid, it took quite a while to complete bag drop, specifically around 50 minutes. The flight was delayed by about half an hour. As a budget airline, the flight was adequate, it felt safe, wasn’t particularly comfortable and pretty much delivered as expected... if not a little better. The seat was wider than expected, and staff were more helpful than I’d have thought. I wasn’t fond of the lack of a seat pocket, but it it did give me extra leg room so points to them for that. Seats are non-reclining because of course they would be and While the safety card being printed on the seatback is a clever idea to save weight and all, it’d be nice if they calmed down a little with all the yellow. I wonder how the new “game changer” seats would feel .. they look nicer, but do they also improve on comfort? I got off the 2 hour flight with a numbness that I’ve never really felt before.",1,0.7812232868883231

Today I flew from Dublin to Malaga. The flight was 30 minutes late departing. Apologies were made. The Spanish based crew were very pleasant and my panini and tea were delivered with a smile. One issue I have is not being able to hear the inflight tannoy. To all those who write here, read their rules, check in online, print your boarding passes or use their (really easy) app, book seats if you want to sit together. This is a low cost airline with great fares.",1,0.771232932059126

"London Stansted to Barcelona. I have taken a small cabin bag that is standard measure to any airline but Ryanair charged me GBP/Euro25 per flight because my luggage was oversized! Their reason was that it will not fit in the overhead compartment nor under the seats. However, I took the luggage inside the aircraft and fit it perfectly in the overhead compartment and under the seat and I have pictures to prove it.

"Lisbon to Milan. This company commands their staff to rip you off as much as they can at the check-in counters, it’s really unreasonable. My ticket baggage allowance was 20kg x 3 bags total 60kg. At the counter, I wanted to check in 2 bags total weight of 50kg. The short hair woman at the Lisbon airport terminal 2 counter said I had to check in one more bag or I must pay £110.00 in excess baggage. Something about maximum per bag is 20kg and not more. I saw the baggage allowance policy online that you are able to pool your luggage together to make the allowed weight. But I decided to let it go and bought an empty luggage from the nearby shop for £120.00 to check in at a total weight of 53kg. What’s more, since I didn’t print my boarding pass I had to pay an additional £110.00 to check-in at the counter. Totally spent an extra of £230.00 for nothing at all. Just see the number of people queuing up being coerced to pay for additional things at the Ryanair counters vs easyJet counters tells you they are an absolute rip off.",0,1.0
"Last night, the day after my fathers funeral, I flew home from Kerry airport to Luton. Despite having flown this route numerous times over the last few weeks with the same airline approved luggage while my dad has been in Intensive Care, Ryanair chose this flight to single me out and charge €100 for mine and my children’s 4 bags. The member of staff was not interested in the fact I had buried my father the day before and was insensitive and rude. On boarding the aircraft, I photographed numerous bags in the overhead luggage of the same dimensions as mine, on questioning the other passengers they had not been charged any extra for this luggage.

"I take several times per year the Ryanair flight from Nice to Dublin since 2016 (for working reasons), so my experience is rather big and I would say statistically significant! The flight time is late in the evening, the arrival in Dublin (depending on the season) is scheduled generally after 11 pm. The flight is constantly delayed, I think only 2 or 3 times the flight left at the right time according to my experience. This has often caused me serious problems as my final destination in Ireland is not Dublin but Galway, and the last bus I can catch is at 00.30. This means that several times I had to sleep at the airport and wait for the next bus (around 5.30 am). Many times I asked the flight crew if any options were available such as hotel accommodation (at least at a special price) or alternative transportation. Last time (a month ago) they offered a 4 euros snack coupon for a 2 and half hours delay, I did not know whether to laugh at their faces or cry! Additionally the communication of such enormous delays are always made at the very last moment, making very complicated the organization of an alternative way. This company is an absolute disaster, I keep taking this flight because I simply do not have any other choice",0,1.0

The initial flight was at 0605 hours on the Monday morning and we were to fly back on the Thursday at 1045 hours. This would give us almost three full days in Rome. A matter of weeks after I bought the trip, Ryanair changed the flight time to more than 4 hours later meaning that we did not get to Rome until late afternoon. By the time we got the bus into Rome and checked into our hotel, almost the entire day was gone meaning we only had two days in Rome. Due to the fact that this was part of a package with Expedia, I did not have much of a choice but to agree to this change. The flight was okay, with Ryanair, you get what you pay for but I resent being messed about. Poor customer service.",0,1.0

Ryanair (really Ryanunfair) responded with ""no refunds"" and sent documents to the credit card company supporting their position, which included a page of flight information that had nothing to do with our trip.

I will discourage everyone trying to fly with this airline. The price might be cheap but they will try to get money form everything else. I had to pay £55 for check in at the airport (never happened to me before after lots of flights) and they never sent me an email (as all airlines usually do) to check in. Of course they do that intentionally so you have to do the check in at the airport and charge you for it. Also the staff are disrespectful and not professional at all. Not people you can talk to.

"London Luton to Vilnius. I rang Ryan Air a full 14 days before my outbound flight to let them know that I would not be able to travel after all due to family/personal reasons. As I had paid for their optional 'one trip travel insurance' I told them that I would be claiming my flight costs back via the insurance policy. To cut a long story short: I was told that Ryanair has no cancellation policy and that I would have to wait for at least 24 hours after my return journey and then phone Ryanair again to request a 'Did Not Show' confirmation letter. This will form step one in the insurance claim process. As my return flight was booked for 10th November I, therefore, phoned Ryanair 12th November. They told me they will email me the necessary 'Did Not Show' letter and that I can expect this in the next 8 working days. I said that this was a ridiculously long time to wait, particularly when the customer service agent said she could see that I hadn't used the ticket and would, therefore, be instructing the DNS letter to be processed immediately. When I asked what the procedure was once I had received the DNS letter she said she did not know but was sure that instructions would be included in the email. My issues are: I informed Ryanair 24th October that I would not be using my ticket but was told that I could not start to claim back my flight costs until at least 2 days after my return flight. This meant there would be an empty seat travelling to Vilnius 7th November and an empty seat travelling back to Luton on 10th November. As Ryanair confirmed there was no way of cancelling my ticket/seat then I must assume those seats were left empty! That sounds like very bad commercial practice - not something I would expect of a low cost/budget airline. Ryanair offers 'one trip travel insurance' at the time of booking and then cannot explain the procedure for making a claim against the insurance policy. They blame it on the fact that their insurers are a 'third party'! Check! The transaction was made between me and Ryanair and I expect Ryanair to be responsible. I now have to wait possibly another 10 days simply to start the claiming process - a process which I am still in the dark about. How much longer will this take? It's only when things go wrong, or are slightly outside the norm', that the 'you get what you pay for' adage comes home to roost!",0,1.0

We had to go to the front of the plane trying to pass by passengers going into their own seats, I felt so stupid saying sorry repeatedly to people and explaining to them that our back seats were taken and we didn't know till now. We dont have a problem giving up our seats to those who needed it but it's worse when you are not told before you start to board the plane.

"Return flight from Trieste to Stansted. I flew out with a soft hand luggage bag that I have used on countless Ryanair flights, including my outbound trip to Trieste where I was visiting for 3 days. Upon my return, I was made to pay €25 as my bag 'did not meet Ryanair's restrictions'- despite fitting comfortably within the measuring 'cage' that Ryanair staff use to assess whether luggage can or can't fit in the overhead compartments. Despite my bag fitting in the cage (and therefore meeting Ryanair's restrictions), my was deemed too long. Bear in mine this was not a hard-shell style bag but rather a soft leather bag i.e. malleable. The most frustrating part of this was that I had flown out with the same bag, hadn't purchased any additional items, and have used this bag on every flight I have ever taken with Ryanair. In spite of my explanation, the staff had clearly made up her mind and decided I should pay rather than use any sense of initiative. In short, well done Ryanair.

Seating may not be luxurious and on board refreshments quite expensive but both are on par with other low cost airlines. Staff are welcoming and do what they can to comply with any special requests. Recently for the first time I experienced a delay departing from Alicante due to mechanical problems with in bound plane. I went on to the Ryanair website and filled in a short form, received an apology within hours and a promise of compensation within 21 days. Several days later I received the money into my bank account. I regularly purchase airline tickets for my children to bring them from various UK airports to Alicante and over the years have had problems with long delay from other airlines - including: when one was 7 months pregnant and had to endure a 2 and a half hours delay sitting in the plane on the tarmac in Alicante. Eventually all passenger were given one free bottle of water! The airline is no longer in business!!",0,0.6901450962228293
"Palma to Prestwick. 6 mins late for check in and told its Ryanair policy to leave family with special assistance child at airport until I paid. Misdirection at airport standing in wrong queue and my sons autistic meltdown made me 6 mins late, had to borrow €275 then I got no special assistant which I booked. My flight is delayed 5 hours and I got told I couldn't get the 4 euro snack. 6 mins late £240, they are 5 hours late and nothing. Their  live chat disconnects you when you ask them about checking in. I will never use this company again.",0,0.9078626223675828
"Barcelona to Manchester. The staff at the gate overcharged my husband to check his saxophone and gave us such a hard time even though everyone else at the gate was trying to be helpful. My husband is always allowed to carry the sax on the plane. He would not give his name so we could not complain to the Ryanair management. He would not get a manager to help us. When we got on the plane, the guy who takes the checked bags said we could board with the sax. No one gave us a problem.",0,1.0
Fes to Paris. You pay for everything and charged you double if you don’t do it online. Got charged for my bag and boarding pass cause they don’t have online tickets. Paid for priority and  x cabin bags why am I getting charged for a cabin bag like that doesn’t make sense. The flight was supposed to be 57 dollars and I ended paying 120 dollars.,0,1.0
"Amsterdam to Dublin. This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with any business in my life. My flight more than doubled in hidden fees. You can’t go through to check baggage until 2 hours within flight and if you’re not at gate an hour before take off they might not let you on. Customer service are robots. So unhelpful and a lot of automated responses. They also won’t send you email confirmations to check in, and your login only sometimes works. And then if you don’t check in online you get charged. If you don’t print boarding pass at home then you get charged, not allowed to use online boarding pass.",0,0.9322341671685087
"Beauvais to Bratislava. I had two trouble free flights within last two weeks. The fares were very cheap. I purchased priority boarding, so had 2 cabin bags allowance. Website experience was good, the mobile application worked fine, and apple pay functionality was a big convenience. The only strange thing about website vs application experience is that when purchasing priority boarding you can not buy 10 kg checked bag allowance on the website. On mobile you can do this. Another thing to watch is cost of this service. It changes, and the price can double, so if you need it, it is better to buy it early. At the airport check-in desk was not overcrowded. Boarding was fast and efficient, with usual nasty waiting when priority line had to be formed on the stairs and then lined up near the plane. But flying low cost you have to accept this. Onboard everything was ok. Seats are passably comfortable. I purchased hot meal and it was tasty. Toilet condition was good. Departures and arrivals both times on schedule. I was able to read all the bad reviews, but as I can see most of them are written by the people who didn't follow rules and been fined for that. For me the main difference between legacy carriers and low cost is that legacy bring you to your destination whatever happens (they put you on different flight or on competition company or re-route you). Low cost carriers just say sorry and do refund. This is where the real difference is. All the rest become more and more identical.",1,0.6632916472386556
"Ibiza to Milano Bergamo. Before getting to the airport I have received the notification that online check-in was required otherwise a fee of 55 Euro per person would have applied. I tried to do the check in at the airport (2,5h before flight departure) and the app was malfunctioning. I requested some help from the info desk and they could not solve the problem or even help in any way. After a while they realised that I needed to board and gave me no options other than paying 110 euro (2 people) at the counter. They suggested me to contact the customer care straight away and explain the issue.  I did so right after and sent an email through their website. They answered me after 10 days telling me that I should have done the check in online.I then contacted the customer care via the live chat and they were absolutely useless. They told me to call the call center and provided me with a number that work only if you are calling from Europe. Once I explained that I live in Australia they said they are sorry and that there was nothing they could do.",0,1.0
"Prague to Bologna with Ryanair. Paid for carry-on, forced to use check-in, carry on not refunded. Customer Service are robots. No humanity. I am tired of feeling like the object of their constant sales pitches.",0,1.0
